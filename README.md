## Project Overview:
We predict the genuineness of a website based on the majority of user
ratings, and ML model trained using features like website’s scraped data,
user's ratings/ reviews data from the website. Users further would be
asked to tell which portions of the article made them think the article is
fake and provide basis for their report . We aim to provide users with data
on which websites are genuine and not genuine and protect the users
malicious websites and fraud.
