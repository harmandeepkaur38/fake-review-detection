      "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n",
      "Updated April 11, 2020\n",
      "When will this end?\n",
      "This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)\n",
      "What should I do if I feel sick?\n",
      "If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n",
      "Should I wear a mask?\n",
      "The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n",
      "How do I get tested?\n",
      "If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n",
      "How does coronavirus spread?\n",
      "It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n",
      "Is there a vaccine yet?\n",
      "No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n",
      "What makes this outbreak so different?\n",
      "Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.\n",
      "What if somebody in my family gets sick?\n",
      "If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.\n",
      "Should I stock up on groceries?\n",
      "Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n",
      "Can I go to the park?\n",
      "Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n",
      "Should I pull my money from the markets?\n",
      "That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n",
      "What should I do with my 401(k)?\n",
      "Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”\n",

They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind,\" he said.\"Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure - roads, warehouses, ports.

Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity. I urge you all to think about this and contribute to the discourse,\" he said.The Prime Minister's post comes on a day when a police case has been filed against a hospital in Uttar Pradesh after it placed an ad in local papers that it would admit Muslim patients only after COVID-19 screening.An event hosted by the Muslim sect Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi's Nizamuddin had become a hotspot after thousands of its members were found infected with COVID-19. A Muslim group later approached the Supreme Court, seeking to stop sections of the media from allegedly giving a communal colour to reportage on COVID-19 cases linked to the event held in Nizamuddin.The number of coronavirus cases in India has climbed to 16,116, which includes 519 deaths, the Health Ministry said today, adding that 1,324 cases and 31 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.On Saturday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh chaired a meeting of a Group of Ministers (GoM) at his residence to and discussed re-starting economic activity in non-containment zones after April 20, in line with announcements made by PM Modi earlier this week.

Some doctors are misusing them. The rollout is nowhere close to the demand.A Long Island resident’s blood was screened for coronavirus antibodies on Tuesday in Hempstead, N.Y.Credit...Seth Wenig/Associated PressBy Steve Eder, Megan Twohey and Apoorva MandavilliApril 19, 2020Updated 1:59 p.m. ETA law firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., tested employees who hoped, with the prick of a finger, to learn if they might be immune. In Laredo, Tex., community leaders secured 20,000 of the new tests to gauge how many residents had been infected. In Chicago, a hospital screened firefighters to help determine whether they could safely stay on the job.In recent weeks, the United States has seen the first rollout of blood tests for coronavirus antibodies, widely heralded as crucial tools to assess the reach of the pandemic in the United States, restart the economy and reintegrate society.But for all their promise, the tests — intended to signal whether people may have built immunity to the virus — are already raising alarms.Officials fear the effort may prove as problematic as the earlier launch of diagnostic tests that failed to monitor which Americans, and how many, had been infected or developed the disease the virus causes. Criticized for a tragically slow and rigid oversight of those tests months ago, the federal government is now faulted by public health officials and scientists for greenlighting the antibody tests too quickly and without adequate scrutiny.The Food and Drug Administration has allowed about 90 companies, many based in China, to sell tests that have not gotten government vetting, saying the pandemic warrants an urgent response. But the agency has since warned that some of those businesses are making false claims about their products; health officials, like their counterparts overseas, have found others deeply flawed.Tests of “frankly dubious quality” have flooded the American market, said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Many of them, akin to home pregnancy tests, are easy to take and promise rapid results.And the federal guidance that does exist is so confusing that health care providers are administering certain tests unaware that they may not be authorized to do so. Some are misusing antibody test results to diagnose the disease, not realizing that they can miss the early stages of infection.“People don’t understand how dangerous this test is,” said Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. “We sacrificed quality for speed, and in the end, when it’s people’s lives that are hanging in the balance, safety has to take precedence over speed.”Even as government agencies, companies and academic researchers scramble to validate existing tests and create better ones, there are doubts they can deliver as promised. Most tests now available mistakenly flag at least some people as having antibodies when they do not, which could foster a dangerously false belief that those people have immunity.And even if the tests do improve, their availability could be hampered by the same manufacturing shortages that have prevented the Covid-19 diagnostic tests from scaling up adequately.As President Trump presses to reopen the country and several states are considering lifting lockdowns in the next few weeks, widespread screening is considered critical. On Friday, Mr. Trump cheered the F.D.A.’s emergency approval of some antibody tests, saying they would support efforts to get Americans back to work “by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful, immunity.”Epidemiologists are testing for antibodies in hot spots to better measure the extent of the outbreaks, and government officials intend to use those results to help decide when and how to return residents to daily life. But many scientists and political leaders say the country is nowhere close to deploying enough diagnostic and antibody tests at the speed and volume required.“The more testing, the more open the economy,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday. He has pushed for the production of antibody tests as a central cog in plans to ease stay-at-home restrictions, saying that New York would eventually screen 100,000 people a day.\n",

      "Recent testing around the country demonstrates the challenges of using the new products. At the Chicago hospital, for example, the city’s Public Health Department intervened, warning that it should not use antibody tests to determine whether emergency workers were actively infected.Soon after it helped screen the Rose Law Group, the firm in Arizona, a lab stopped providing rapid tests to other clients, fearing they might not comply with federal guidelines, and switched to more sophisticated lab-based tests.In Laredo, officials discovered the tests they received were woefully inadequate. The local health department found them to have a reliability of about 20 percent, far from the 93 to 97 percent the company had claimed. A police investigation led to a federal seizure of the tests.“The city was disappointed, but during a time of crisis, we are doing everything possible to scour the earth to have tests available for the public,” said Rafael Benavides, the city’s public information officer.“It’s a real mess,” Dr. Osterholm said. “This is the wild, wild West in terms of testing, and at a time when we need real definition of what these tests mean.”A Medical Free-for-AllMore than 90 companies have jumped into the market since the F.D.A. eased its rules and allowed antibody tests to be sold without formal federal review or approval.Some of those companies are start-ups; others have established records. In a federal guidance document on March 16, the F.D.A. required them to validate their results on their own and notify the agency that they had done so.Their products vary. Some test only for a transient antibody that spikes while the body is in the throes of an active infection. An antibody that peaks about four weeks after infection and marks longer-term immunity is a separate target. There are tests that look for both antibodies; others also look for a third involved in respiratory infections.The most reliable ones involve a laboratory technique called Elisa that can indicate the amount of antibodies a person may have. Higher levels generally mean a stronger physiological response, but it is unclear what levels are needed for immunity to the new coronavirus — or how long it would last.“We’re really far from that,” Dr. Osterholm said. “We’re not even in the second inning of a nine-inning game at this point.”Most of the tests offered are rapid tests that can be assessed in a doctor’s office — or, eventually, even at home — and provide simple yes-or-no results. Makers of the tests have aggressively marketed them to businesses and doctors, and thousands of Americans have already taken them, costing a patient roughly $60 to $115.Rapid tests are by far the easiest to administer. But they are also the most unreliable — so much so that the World Health Organization recommends against their use.Most are manufactured in China. Reports of countries that quickly bought millions have just as swiftly been followed by accounts of poor performance.For example, Britain recently said the millions of rapid tests it had ordered from China were not sensitive enough to detect antibodies except in people who were severely ill. In Spain, the testing push turned into a fiasco last month after the initial batch of kits it received had an accuracy of 30 percent, rather than the advertised 80 percent. In Italy, local officials have begun testing even before national authorities have validated the tests.“The problems mainly happen with rapid tests,” said Dr. Giorgio Palù, an Italian microbiologist and former president of the European Society for Virology. “They will never be able to tell the spread of the virus because they do not have the required sensitivity and specificity.”Germany, which has emerged as a model among Western democracies in its efforts to curb the spread of the virus, is pursuing one of the most ambitious antibody studies, striving to test its entire population. It is more optimistic than other countries because it has made its own antibody tests and conducted extensive diagnostic screening from the beginning.This month, the F.D.A. warned that some firms marketing their antibody tests in the United States were falsely claiming that they had formal federal approval, or that they could diagnose Covid-19.In an effort to speed up access, the F.D.A. apparently did not fully consider how these tests would be administered. The agency released a guidance document saying that antibody tests could be performed at “point-of-care” settings, indicating that doctors, nurses and others could give them to patients in their offices. But agency officials also acknowledged that under federal law, if a test has not been authorized by the agency, it must be conducted in so-called high-complexity laboratories, like some large commercial facilities or public health labs. The officials decline to provide additional clarification.“If you are getting an antibody test and it’s being conducted in your physician’s office, it’s a red flag,” said Kelly Wroblewski, director of the infectious disease programs for the Association of Public Health Laboratories.No action has been taken against doctors, but as companies realized the ambiguity of the federal guidelines, some changed course, shifting to lab-based tests or pursuing formal federal approval, which would allow their products to be used at doctors’ offices and even at home.The F.D.A. has received requests for emergency-use authorization from 120 antibody-testing developers. So far it has granted formal approval to just four: Cellex, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Chembio Diagnostic Systems and the Mount Sinai Laboratory.Mr. Becker, of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said he was heartened to see more developers seeking the authorization, describing it as “the gold standard.”In a statement on Saturday, the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, said that “every step we have taken as part of our approach to Covid-19 testing has been a careful balancing of risks and benefits,” adding, “We are continuing to learn and adapt based on the real-world experience and data we’re seeing.”Everybody Wants OneHospitals, municipalities and businesses have quickly moved into the first wave of antibody screening. They are acquiring kits from private suppliers, pairing up with research institutions or making their own lab-based tests.The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania began screening health care workers this past week as part of a clinical study of people who are infected but asymptomatic.Eurofins, a network of clinical labs, is partnering with Boston Heart Diagnostics to test employees at 100 hospitals, including the V.A. New England Healthcare System, which serves about 265,000 patients a year. In Michigan, Beaumont Health is offering voluntary testing to its 38,000 employees and thousands of affiliates.“Everybody’s a little nervous about how protected they are really,” said Dr. Matthew D. Sims, Beaumont’s director of infectious diseases research. “We want to give everybody as much peace of mind as we can.”Physicians say antibody tests can be useful if given as part of a broader range of care.Dr. Ida Bergstrom, based in Washington, described the rapid tests as only “one tool” in the arsenal against the virus. Dr. Syed Ashraf advises patients in Northern Virginia that positive results, while not “a free license to run around and do whatever you feel like,” can help clear someone to move forward.Dene Callas, an advertising executive in Santa Monica, Calif., quickly accepted when her doctor offered to test her this month. An initial rapid test was invalid; a second one came back negative. Still, Ms. Callas believed she had contracted the virus and recovered: She had attended a conference in Las Vegas in January and fallen ill within days. A positive test, she said, would have made a difference. “I would be a little braver outside,” she said. “I would be out there volunteering if I knew I had the antibodies.”Some large employers, including Goldman Sachs and Twitter, have looked into antibody tests but not bought any. Amazon has not focused on antibody screening, though it intends to roll out diagnostic testing for the hundreds of thousands of people in its warehouse and logistics network, according to people familiar with the plans.Some smaller businesses, though, have pursued the new tests. At John Christner Trucking, a food transportation company near Tulsa, Okla., about 220 workers took rapid tests. They were concerned about exposure after two were infected with the virus. A small number came back positive, said Danny Christner, the chief executive. “I knew it wasn’t a silver bullet, but it was some information that people could be aware of,” he said.The Chicago Public Health Department bought 5,500 rapid tests and put them to use in homeless shelters. Those who were positive for the early antibodies were placed in hotel rooms rented by the city and given a diagnostic test to confirm the infection, said Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the department. The next step may be testing people in nursing homes, she said.Sports leagues are also considering how antibody tests can figure into their plans. The N.B.A., with its season paused, has been approached about purchasing tests and is awaiting guidance from public health officials.Major League Baseball employees and players will be tested as part of a 10,000-person nationwide study run by outside researchers to better understand the scale of infection. A players’ union official said the testing was voluntary and not connected to beginning the season.In Search of a Test That WorksWhile political leaders and some health officials say that antibody testing will be essential to reopening the country, it is unlikely to meet expectations anytime soon.Less than 5 percent of the U.S. population may be infected, and even in hot zones like New York or New Orleans, the prevalence may not be higher than 10 to 15 percent, according to Dr. Osterholm. In China, early screening in hard-hit Wuhan indicates that only about three percent of the population has antibodies against the new coronavirus.When the proportion of people exposed is that low, the tests’ false positive rate — signaling antibodies where there are none — can limit the tests’ utility.Even Cellex’s F.D.A.-authorized test has a false positive rate of about five percent. That is still a significant margin of error: In a community where five percent of people have had the virus, Dr. Osterholm said, there would be as many false positives as true ones.“What are you going to do with that? Are you going to say you’re not going to distance?” he said. “I don’t think that would give me peace of mind at all.”Some tests on the market without federal approval are likely to have even higher false positive rates. It is unclear how these companies have validated their tests or how they stack up against one another.Researchers at the National Institutes of Health are validating some of the tests in cooperation with the F.D.A. Last week, a German group published a small analysis of nine tests and found, as might be expected, that some performed better than others. A research group backed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is working to assess all available tests using the same set of samples for each, with early results expected next week.“There’s an urgent need to know which of these tests we can rely on — I think the only way we can know is head-to-head testing,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, one of the leaders of the project and a microbiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.“The ideal outcome is not to pick a winner but to pick as many winners as possible so the world can have a diversified list of tests,” he added.President Trump has said that once the federal government had finished validating the antibody tests, manufacturing would swiftly meet demand. But that may not be realistic.Most companies are buying rapid tests from China, though they are unsure if and when they will become available. Early on, Chinese businesses could sell their products freely, but now, Chinese officials have signaled that only antibody tests approved by the country’s government can be exported. So far, China’s National Medical Products Administration has authorized only 11.A start-up in Los Angeles, Scanwell Health, expected to receive a million tests each week from Innovita, one of the 11 companies. But it is still waiting for its first shipment of 10,000, which was scheduled to arrive three weeks ago.Companies and health officials are also predicting shortages of the reagents and components required to assemble the tests.“As many scientific challenges as there are right now,” said Scott Hensley, leading the University of Pennsylvania study, “there’s an equally large engineering challenge and scalability challenge to get these on the market.”Reporting was contributed by Emma Bubola, Kate Conger, Sopan Deb, Hana de Goeij, Ellen Gabler, Constant Méheut, Raphael Minder, Alexandra Stevenson, James Wagner and Karen Weise.\n",
      "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n",
      "Updated April 11, 2020\n",
      "When will this end?\n",
      "This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)\n",
      "What should I do if I feel sick?\n",
      "If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n",
      "Should I wear a mask?\n",
      "The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n",
      "How do I get tested?\n",
      "If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n",
      "How does coronavirus spread?\n",
      "It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n",
      "Is there a vaccine yet?\n",
      "No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n",
      "What makes this outbreak so different?\n",
      "Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.\n",
      "What if somebody in my family gets sick?\n",
      "If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.\n",
      "Should I stock up on groceries?\n",
      "Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n",
      "Can I go to the park?\n",
      "Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n",
      "Should I pull my money from the markets?\n",
      "That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n",
      "What should I do with my 401(k)?\n",
      "Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”\n",

      "Coronavirus: In tweets on Sunday, West Bengal Health and Family Welfare Department asked the ICMR to investigate the issue immediately All IndiaWritten by Monideepa BanerjieUpdated: April 20, 2020 12:57 am ISTCoronavirus: Bengal said kits supplied by ICMR is throwing up inconclusive resultsKolkata: Faulty kits supplied by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the country's nodal body for COVID-19 testing, have been throwing up inconclusive results and delaying the pace of testing, the West Bengal government has said.In tweets on Sunday, the state's Department of Health and Family Welfare has urged the ICMR to investigate the issue immediately as the delays have resulted in the need for repeat and confirmatory tests that are slowing down the battle against the pandemic. West Bengal has reported 310 cases of COVID-19 so far and 12 deaths, the Health Ministry's data shows. The cases have been rising in the last three days.While an ICMR response is awaited, the director of the Council's nodal body in Kolkata said that the matter was being seriously addressed.\"It is unfortunate that the kits are not standardised to give exact results. It is difficult for each of the medical colleges to standardise the kits, hence, they are showing different and inconclusive results,\" said Dr Shanta Dutta, Director of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) in Kolkata.Initially, she said, kits were being assembled and standardised at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. As the demand increased, the ICMR started importing ready-made kits and sending them to 26 depots for onward delivery to laboratories under its purview across the country.NICED is one such depot and supplies kits to Odisha and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, besides West Bengal.\"There was no problem earlier when the testing kits were being received directly from the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Recently, the supplies to government labs in West Bengal have been routed through ICMR-NICED, Kolkata,\" the department tweeted on Sunday.3/5 There was no problem earlier when the testing kits were being received directly from National Institute of Virology, Pune. Recently, the supplies to Government Labs in West Bengal have been routed through ICMR-NICED, Kolkata.— Department of Health & Family Welfare, West Bengal (@wbdhfw) April 19, 2020\"The apparently defective test kits supplied by ICMR-NICED are resulting in a high number of repeat/confirmatory tests and causing delays and other attendant problems at a time when we are battling a pandemic,\" it said.5/5 The apparently defective test kits supplied by ICMR-NICED, Kolkata are resulting in a high number of repeat/ confirmatory tests and causing delays and other attendant problems at a time when we are battling a pandemic. This is an issue that ICMR needs to look into immediately— Department of Health & Family Welfare, West Bengal (@wbdhfw) April 19, 2020The tweets have raised eyebrows because of a reference to \"mischievous reports in social media about the alleged delay in the time taken for testing swab samples\" in the state.Just last week, in a series of interviews to the media, the NICED Director had questioned the low testing rate for COVID-19 in West Bengal and denied that a shortage of kits was responsible for it.Dr Dutta had also questioned the declining number of swab samples that NICED had been receiving from the state government. In the week ending April 12, she said her lab was getting a maximum of 20 samples a day, when its capacity to test was 80-90 samples.Her comments had created a stir in West Bengal and beyond because the state was, indeed, at the bottom of the list when it came to figures of testing per million.The West Bengal government will start rapid antibody and pool testing to detect COVID-19 patients, the state government said in a statement on Sunday. Mass testing for coronavirus can be made low cost by pool testing - conducting tests of groups of five persons as a poll, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said.

Leaders say a second lifeline for small businesses and hospitals nears approval. Right NowExperts say the pandemic may become another powerful force driving young adults away from crowded, expensive major city centers to live in smaller cities or suburbs.Here’s what you need to know:Pressed to reopen, governors say their states need more time and more testing. As a stimulus bill omitting local aid advances, ‘are you telling New York City to drop dead?’ The pandemic may profoundly alter U.S. cities.Labs warn of quality problems with new antibody tests.A judge in Kansas lifts restrictions on church gatherings.How the coronavirus became a new frontier in the fight for civil rights.Scrambling behind the scenes as Hollywood comes to a halt.ImageA New York City police officer outside a walk-in coronavirus testing center in the Bronx on Saturday.Credit...Desiree Rios for The New York TimesPressed to reopen, governors say their states need more time and more testing. Across the country, governors are finding themselves caught between increasingly competitive pressures, several said on Sunday, as they balance maintaining restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus against growing frustration with the restrictions and the economic anguish they cause. In Maryland and Virginia, governors said stay-at-home orders would have to remain in effect until those states begin to see decreases in the number of Covid-19 cases. Elsewhere in the nation, state officials said they would need to conduct far more testing before easing restrictions, and continue to face shortages of supplies and testing kits.“We are fighting a biological war,” Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said on the “State of the Union” program on CNN. He added that governors have been forced “to fight that war without the supplies we need.”Trump administration officials asserted on Sunday that the current pace of testing was adequate. On the NBC program “Meet the Press,” Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday morning that “there is a sufficient capacity of testing across the country today for any state in America to go to a Phase One level” of easing some restrictions.But governors insisted that testing was still being hamstrung by shortages. Mr. Northam, a Democrat, called Mr. Pence’s claim “delusional,” saying that Virginia lacks the swabs needed for the tests. Gov. Gretchen ​Whitmer of Michigan, another Democrat, said her state could handle “double or triple” the current number of tests “if we had the swabs or reagents.” ​And Gov. Larry Hogan​ of Maryland said that it was “absolutely false” to claim that governors were not acting aggressively enough to pursue as much testing as possible.“It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there and the governors should just get it done,” Mr. Hogan​, a Republican,​ said​ in an interview on “State of the Union​.”​ “That’s just not being straightforward.”Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House, also pushed back against criticism that enough people were not being tested, saying that not every community required high levels of testing and that tens of thousands of test results were probably not being reported. She said the government was trying “to predict community by community the testing that is needed,” Dr. Birx said on the CBS program “Face the Nation​” on Sunday.​ “Each will have a different testing need, and that’s what we’re calculating now.”On the ABC program “This Week,” Dr. Birx said she thought statistics on testing were incomplete: “When you look at the number of cases that have been diagnosed, you realize that there’s probably 30,000 to 50,000 additional tests being done that aren’t being reported right now.”Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts SayAs some governors look to ease coronavirus restrictions, public health experts say the country needs at least half a million tests per day to safely reopen.There are currently about 150,000 diagnostic tests conducted each day, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Researchers at Harvard estimated last week that in order to ease restrictions, the nation needed to at least triple that pace of testing.When the host of “This Week,” George Stephanopoulos, asked Dr. Birx about that estimate, she said current testing levels were adequate. “We believe it’s been enough in a whole series of the outbreak areas — when you see how Detroit has been able to test, Louisiana, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey,” Dr. Birx said.She said that a team at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland was calling hundreds of labs around the country to determine exactly what supplies they need “to turn on full capacity, which we believe will double the number of tests that are available for Americans.”During his interview with CNN, Mr. Hogan was shown video images of a long line winding around a supermarket in a Maryland suburb of Washington where free food was being handed out — an unsettling avatar of the economic damage wrought by the virus. He described a dilemma shared with other governors, who say they are eager to restore some sense of normalcy and ease the financial pain but that now is not the time. “My goal is to try to get us open as quickly as we possibly can, but in a safe way,” ​Mr. Hogan said.As a stimulus bill omitting local aid advances, ‘are you telling New York City to drop dead?’ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Sunday they were nearing agreement with the White House to break a political logjam and provide more emergency aid for small businesses and hospitals, as well as to expand testing. Omitted from the bill is any direct aid for states or cities that are struggling to cope with the pandemic, an issue that drew pointed remarks from Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York.The $349 billion small-business emergency fund ran out of money last week, and Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating over the weekend about the terms for replenishing it. On the ABC program “This Week,” Ms. Pelosi said the two sides were “very close to agreement.”\n",
      "Mr. Schumer said a deal could come as soon as Sunday night. “We’ve made very good progress, and I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or early tomorrow morning,” Mr. Schumer said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” He added that many of the Democrats’ requests, including money for testing and hospitals, “they’re going along with, so we feel pretty good.”Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNN Sunday that he was hopeful that the Senate could pass legislation as soon as Monday and that the House would take it up for a vote on Tuesday. The bill would include $300 billion to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program, $50 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief fund, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. Democrats wanted the plan to also include money for states and municipalities, but Mr. Mnuchin said that would be included in a future relief package. Mr. de Blasio derided President Trump on Sunday for failing to speak out about federal aid to municipalities. “What’s going on? Cat got your tongue?” Mr. de Blasio said during his daily briefing. “You’re usually really talkative. You usually have an opinion on everything. How on earth do you not have an opinion on aid to American cities and states?”The mayor, who said earlier in the week that New York City would have to slash more than $2 billion in municipal services over the next year, compared President Trump’s silence with President Gerald Ford’s dismissal of New York City’s plight during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.“There was that famous Daily News cover that said ‘Ford to City: Drop Dread,’” Mr. de Blasio said. “So my question is, Mr. Trump, Mr. President, are you going to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead? Which one is it?”“You are failing to protect the very people you grew up around,” Mr. de Blasio added.The pandemic may profoundly alter U.S. cities.The pandemic has hit America’s biggest cities hard, with the coronavirus finding found fertile ground in their density, just as major urban centers were already losing their appeal for many Americans. Skyrocketing rents and changes in the labor market have been pushing the country’s youngest adults toward suburbs and smaller cities. Will that current turn into a flood?The country’s three largest metropolitan areas — New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — have all lost population in the past few years, according to an analysis by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. And over all, growth in the country’s major metropolitan areas fell by nearly half over the past decade, Mr. Frey found.Now, as local leaders contemplate how to reopen, the future of life in America’s biggest, most dense cities is unclear. Mayors warn of precipitous drops in tax revenue because so many people are now unemployed and so many businesses are closed. Public spaces like parks and mass transit systems, the central arteries of urban life, have become danger zones. And with vast numbers of professionals working remotely, some may reconsider whether they need to live and work in the middle of a big city.“This pandemic has stretched the fabric that was already tearing,” said Aaron Bolzle, the executive director of Tulsa Remote, a program that offers $10,000 to remote workers who relocate to Tulsa, Okla.Of course, the same financial uncertainty that would encourage a move may also make it more difficult. And in general, recessions — recent ones, at least — have tended to be good for cities. But a pandemic makes the equation different, and hard to predict.Labs warn of quality problems with new antibody tests.The United States has seen a rollout of blood tests for coronavirus antibodies in recent weeks. The tests, which are meant to detect past exposure and possible immunity, not current cases of Covid-19, have been widely heralded as crucial tools in assessing the reach of the pandemic in the United States.But for all their promise, the tests are already raising alarms. Officials fear the effort may prove as problematic as the deployment of earlier diagnostic tests. Criticized for a tragically slow and rigid oversight of those tests months ago, the federal government is now faulted by public health officials and scientists for greenlighting the antibody tests too quickly and without adequate scrutiny.Tests of “frankly dubious quality” have flooded the American market, said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.A judge in Kansas lifts restrictions on church gatherings.A federal judge in Kansas has issued a temporary restraining order setting aside the governor’s explicit prohibition on church gatherings in the state. Congregations in Kansas may now meet for in-person services. The ruling, handed down on Saturday, is the latest chapter in the lengthy back-and-forth battle over the issue.In the days leading up to Easter Sunday, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, amended her earlier executive order to include churches in a prohibition on mass gatherings. Republican lawmakers responded by overriding that part of her executive order, but just hours before most Christian denominations were to celebrate Easter on April 12, the state Supreme Court upheld the governor’s order. (Most Orthodox denominations are marking the holiday today.)Two churches — First Baptist in Dodge City and Calvary Baptist in Junction City — sued the governor in federal court, arguing that her order infringed upon their First Amendment rights to exercise their religion. Governor Kelly’s lawyers have argued that the order did not target religious activity. But the federal judge, John W. Broomes of the United States District Court in Kansas, was skeptical of that explanation, noting that churches had initially been deemed an essential function, and thus exempt from the original executive order. The governor later withdrew that exemption, while continuing to allow gatherings at airports, production facilities and offices, among other locations.Judge Broomes wrote in his ruling that because the governor’s stay-at-home order exempts many secular activities from its ban on large gatherings, “churches and religious activities appear to have been singled out among essential functions for stricter treatment.”“The exemption for religious activities has been eliminated while it remains for a multitude of activities that appear comparable in terms of health risks,” the judge wrote.The judge’s order requires churches to practice social distancing in other respects. A hearing on whether to make the restraining order permanent has been scheduled for Thursday.Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case CountA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.How the coronavirus became a new frontier in the fight for civil rights.The coronavirus pandemic has hit African-Americans and Hispanics especially hard, including in New York, where the virus is twice as deadly for those populations. So in the midst of a national quarantine, civil rights activists are organizing campaigns at home from their laptops and cellphones. Collectively, the goals are targeted legislation, financial investments, and government and corporate accountability. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the longtime civil rights leader, is calling for the creation of a new Kerner Commission to document the “racism and discrimination built into public policies” that make the pandemic measurably worse for some African-Americans.“It’s really hard to overstate the critical moment we are in as a people, given how this virus has ripped through our community,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization with 1.7 million members. “We know the pain will not be shared equally.”Mr. Robinson’s organization and others, such as the National Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P., have hosted telephone and virtual town halls, drafted state and federal policy recommendations and sent letters to legislators.Smaller local groups are working around social distancing restrictions to rally support. And across the country, individuals are making direct pleas for all to help slow the outbreak’s spread.“I am trying to sound the alarm because I see the devastation in the black community,” Michael Fowler, the coroner of Dougherty County, said hours after the Georgia county’s 91st Covid-19 death. “Preachers, a judge, a church choir member, all walks of life are dying. My job is to pronounce death, but I believe in trying to save lives.”Scrambling behind the scenes as Hollywood comes to a halt.As with much of life around the world, film and television production has ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving actors, stylists, directors, studio chiefs, grips, writers, set builders, trailer cutters, agents and scores of other specialized Hollywood workers at home and confronting the same question: Now what?Across the industry, shooting is not expected to resume until August a the soonest, in part because of the time it will take to reassemble casts and crews once the coronavirus threat subsides. That leaves a vast number of people without work. Hollywood supports 2.5 million jobs, according to the Motion Picture Association of America, and many of the workers are freelancers, getting paid project to project.“I keep telling myself, ‘Panicking is not going to help,’” said Muffett Brinkman, an associate casting director who has been unemployed for more than a month. “Hopefully things restart before I’m completely financially ruined.”What could the year ahead look like for the U.S.?When can people safely emerge from their homes? How long, realistically, before there is a coronavirus treatment or vaccine? How can the virus be kept at bay?More than 20 experts in public health, medicine, epidemiology and history shared their thoughts on the future during in-depth interviews with The New York Times.Some said that American ingenuity, once fully engaged, might produce advances to ease the burdens. Several saw a path forward that depends on factors that are difficult but possible: a carefully staggered approach to reopening, widespread coronavirus testing and tracking, a treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers — and eventually an effective vaccine.“My optimistic side says the virus will ease off in the summer and a vaccine will arrive like the cavalry,” one said. “But I’m learning to guard against my essentially optimistic nature.”Most experts believed that once the crisis is over, the nation and its economy will revive quickly — but that there will be no escaping a period of intense pain.A somber broadcast remembers the Oklahoma City bombing.The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed 25 years ago today, in what remains\n",
      "America’s deadliest single homegrown act of terrorism. The bombing killed 168 people, including 19 children.The coronavirus outbreak has forced the National Memorial Museum to cancel the weeklong series of events meant to mark the occasion. Instead, the museum recorded an hourlong memorial program that was broadcast on local television stations Sunday morning and is available online.The virtual ceremony started with 168 seconds of silence, while the video showed the main, poignant memorial to the dead. Rows of bronze, stone and glass chairs, 168 in all, overlook the reflecting pool built where the building once stood.Then a series of prominent politicians made brief remarks, before survivors read the names of those who perished.A white supremacist, Timothy McVeigh, built a 7,000-pound truck bomb that he blew up at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, shearing off the building’s glass face and pancaking its nine floors.Before he was executed in June 2001, Mr. McVeigh expressed disappointment that his attack did not ignite a widespread uprising against the U.S. government.The bombing remains something of an anomaly.Between Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, it was the deadliest deliberate attack on the United States, yet it has not been similarly woven into the tapestry of American history. Many historians, along with those who were attacked, worry that the memory is fading even as the violent ideology that inspired Mr. McVeigh spreads.“In today’s political environment, I hear echoes of the kind of rhetoric that I think inspired the perpetrators of the bombing,” said David F. Holt, the mayor of Oklahoma City.School cafeterias are now feeding whole families.After the coronavirus shut down America’s education system, districts fortified their school meals programs to ensure that their most needy students would stay fed. One month in, school leaders realize that the federal programs set up to subsidize meals for tens of millions of students cannot meet the demands of an emergency that has turned their cafeterias into food banks and community kitchens.Several districts are now feeding adults and sending days’ worth of food home for entire families. And they are doing so at a cost that under federal rules they will not recoup.The nation’s 12 largest school districts will spend $12 million to $19 million through the end of June to meet the demands of their pandemic meals operations, estimated Katie Wilson, the executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance, whose members include large urban districts in Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York and Chicago.The organization, which is pleading for relief from Congress, the Agriculture Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has also set up a donation page to help districts cover costs.“Every one of these schools that has their doors open are literally heroes on the front line,” Ms. Wilson said. “Food workers are now first responders.”Around the globe: Volunteers are enforcing India’s lockdown and stoking divisions. India has pursued its lockdown — the world’s largest — with remarkable zeal.People aren’t just dutifully following the law. Many are going above and beyond it. Volunteer virus patrol squads are popping up everywhere, casting an extra net of vigilance over the entire country. Neighborhoods are imposing extra rules and sealing themselves off.The volunteer efforts could help India protect its people from the pandemic. But there’s a downside: concerns about overzealous enforcement targeting the poor and minorities.Lower castes are being shunned more than usual. The term “social distancing” plays straight into centuries of ostracism of certain groups who until recently were called “untouchable.” Muslims, a large minority in a Hindu-dominated land, are facing a burst of bigotry and attacks. “This is one of the problems of overzealousness,’’ said Adarsh Shastri, a politician in the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party. “People get a chance to enforce the laws per their own personal prejudice.”Elsewhere:\n",
      "At least 40 staff members in Afghanistan’s presidential palace have tested positive for Covid-19, forcing President Ashraf Ghani to isolate himself and attend events via video conference amid a raging war with the Taliban.About 100,000 people in Bangladesh ignored a nationwide lockdown to attend the funeral of Maulana Jubayer Ahmed Ansari, a senior member of an Islamist party, amid fears that the virus could spread quickly through the densely populated country.In France, pride in the country’s aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, has given way to finger-pointing and investigations over an outbreak that tore through the vessel’s cramped quarters, infecting more than 1,000 sailors.Our Tokyo bureau chief writes that the city may have been lulled into complacency during the weeks when Japan contained the coronavirus and has seemed “seduced by magical thinking, presuming we are immune when so many others around the world are not.”A return for baseball requires a new debate.If M.L.B. and the players’ union need to fight over the details about a return to play, it may mean that such a return is possible, our columnist Tyler Kepner writes.America wants a baseball season. Nobody knows quite how that will look amid the coronavirus pandemic. Those are the only certainties for a sport that has an unbroken chain of seasons with at least 100 games stretching back to the 19th century.Hopeful hints emerged last week from Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who both touted the feasibility of having teams plays in empty ballparks. But a quandary loomed: If teams cannot sell tickets, how much will the players be paid?“The issue over pay without fans is going to get ugly,” said a top official of one team who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about league matters. “Owners will claim they’d lose money by playing without fans if players get their full per-game salaries, and it may be true. They’re going to want a big reduction in pay from players.”When Major League Baseball and the players’ union agreed on new rules for the delayed season on March 26 — the original opening day — they vowed to discuss “the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate substitute neutral sites.”For the owners, that set up a negotiation on pay structure. But the players’ side has a different interpretation of “economic feasibility,” according to the agent Scott Boras.In a way, this would be a welcome fight, because it would force baseball to set out a clear path to returning. That does not yet exist, and it depends largely on the availability of coronavirus tests, the spread of the pandemic, and authorization from state and local governments.With lockdowns in place, Jehovah’s Witnesses are limited in spreading their message.Across America, most religious groups have stopped coming together in large numbers to pray and hold services, in keeping with stay-at-home orders. They have improvised with online preaching and even drive-in services. Mormons have stopped going door-to-door in the U.S. and called home many missionaries working abroad.Jehovah’s Witnesses — with 1.3 million members in the U.S. who hand out brochures on sidewalks and subway platforms and ring doorbells — are one of the most visible religious groups in the nation. Members are called on to share scriptures in person with nonmembers, warning of an imminent Armageddon and hoping to baptize them with the prospect of living forever.Yet the pandemic led the group’s leaders to decide that, in the interest of safety, Jehovah’s Witnesses should stop witnessing, its practice of in-person attempts at converting people to the group.The move was the first of its kind in the nearly 150 years that the group has existed. It followed anguished discussions at Watchtower headquarters, with leaders deciding on March 20 that knocking on doors would leave the impression that members were disregarding the safety of those they hoped to convert.“This was not an easy decision for anybody,” said Robert Hendriks, the group’s U.S. spokesman. “As you know, our ministry is our life.”Clearing up confusion about keeping safe distances.Six feet is the suggested space to keep between people in stores and on casual strolls, but when we walk briskly or run, air moves differently around us, increasing the space required to maintain a proper social distance.Vacation spots near New York fear that visitors will bring the virus with them.Visitors to the western end of Fire Island are greeted by a large sign telling them to “Stop, turn around, go back.”Visiting Fire Island is not banned — a resident put up the unofficial sign — but it is strongly discouraged by local officials who fear that outsiders might bring the coronavirus to this 32 mile-long barrier island east of New York City.Like many summer vacation areas, the region’s island communities have looked with trepidation at the encroaching virus and the visitors who might be carrying it with them. But the islands have been especially adamant about avoiding possible exposure from newcomers, in part because the isolation that makes them charming also makes them terrible places to fall ill.Although their county, Suffolk, has become a virus hot spot, Fire Island, Shelter Island, Fishers Island each have had few or no documented cases. The same goes for Block Island, just beyond New York waters in Rhode Island.And — fearful that an outbreak that would overwhelm their bare-bones, off-season medical and emergency rescue services — the islands want to keep it that way.Those we’ve lost: Tarlach MacNiallais, who fought for gay and disability rights, dies at 57.Tarlach MacNiallais was known for his decades of advocacy for L.G.B.T.Q. and disability rights.“A battering ram on issues of importance,” according to Harriet Golden, a vice president at A.H.R.C. New York City, an organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, where Mr. MacNiallais worked for nearly 35 years.Moving from Northern Ireland to New York in the mid-1980s, Mr. MacNiallais became involved in the protracted struggle by L.G.B.T.Q. groups to be fully included in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. Many years later, he became a member of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade formation committee, and marched in the parade with the Lavender and Green Alliance in 2016.Mr. MacNiallais died on April 1. He was 57. The cause was complications of the coronavirus, according to friends and family.Those We’ve LostThe coronavirus pandemic has taken an incalculable death toll.

      "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n",
      "Updated April 11, 2020\n",
      "When will this end?\n",
      "This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)\n",
      "What should I do if I feel sick?\n",
      "If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n",
      "Should I wear a mask?\n",
      "The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n",
      "How do I get tested?\n",
      "If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n",
      "How does coronavirus spread?\n",
      "It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n",
      "Is there a vaccine yet?\n",
      "No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n",
      "What makes this outbreak so different?\n",
      "Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.\n",
      "What if somebody in my family gets sick?\n",
      "If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.\n",
      "Should I stock up on groceries?\n",
      "Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n",
      "Can I go to the park?\n",
      "Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n",

Leaders say a second lifeline for small businesses and hospitals nears approval. Right NowExperts say the pandemic may become another powerful force driving young adults away from crowded, expensive major city centers to live in smaller cities or suburbs.Here’s what you need to know:Pressed to reopen, governors say their states need more time and more testing.

Across the country, governors are finding themselves caught between increasingly competitive pressures, several said on Sunday, as they balance maintaining restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus against growing frustration with the restrictions and the economic anguish they cause. In Maryland and Virginia, governors said stay-at-home orders would have to remain in effect until those states begin to see decreases in the number of Covid-19 cases. Elsewhere in the nation, state officials said they would need to conduct far more testing before easing restrictions, and continue to face shortages of supplies and testing kits.“We are fighting a biological war,” Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said on the “State of the Union” program on CNN. He added that governors have been forced “to fight that war without the supplies we need.”Trump administration officials asserted on Sunday that the current pace of testing was adequate. On the NBC program “Meet the Press,” Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday morning that “there is a sufficient capacity of testing across the country today for any state in America to go to a Phase One level” of easing some restrictions.But governors insisted that testing was still being hamstrung by shortages. Mr. Northam, a Democrat, called Mr. Pence’s claim “delusional,” saying that Virginia lacks the swabs needed for the tests. Gov. Gretchen ​Whitmer of Michigan, another Democrat, said her state could handle “double or triple” the current number of tests “if we had the swabs or reagents.” ​And Gov. Larry Hogan​ of Maryland said that it was “absolutely false” to claim that governors were not acting aggressively enough to pursue as much testing as possible.“It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there and the governors should just get it done,” Mr. Hogan​, a Republican,​ said​ in an interview on “State of the Union​.”​ “That’s just not being straightforward.”Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House, also pushed back against criticism that enough people were not being tested, saying that not every community required high levels of testing and that tens of thousands of test results were probably not being reported. She said the government was trying “to predict community by community the testing that is needed,” Dr. Birx said on the CBS program “Face the Nation​” on Sunday.​ “Each will have a different testing need, and that’s what we’re calculating now.”On the ABC program “This Week,” Dr. Birx said she thought statistics on testing were incomplete: “When you look at the number of cases that have been diagnosed, you realize that there’s probably 30,000 to 50,000 additional tests being done that aren’t being reported right now.”Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts SayAs some governors look to ease coronavirus restrictions, public health experts say the country needs at least half a million tests per day to safely reopen.There are currently about 150,000 diagnostic tests conducted each day, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Researchers at Harvard estimated last week that in order to ease restrictions, the nation needed to at least triple that pace of testing.When the host of “This Week,” George Stephanopoulos, asked Dr. Birx about that estimate, she said current testing levels were adequate. “We believe it’s been enough in a whole series of the outbreak areas — when you see how Detroit has been able to test, Louisiana, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey,” Dr. Birx said.She said that a team at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland was calling hundreds of labs around the country to determine exactly what supplies they need “to turn on full capacity, which we believe will double the number of tests that are available for Americans.”During his interview with CNN, Mr. Hogan was shown video images of a long line winding around a supermarket in a Maryland suburb of Washington where free food was being handed out — an unsettling avatar of the economic damage wrought by the virus. He described a dilemma shared with other governors, who say they are eager to restore some sense of normalcy and ease the financial pain but that now is not the time. “My goal is to try to get us open as quickly as we possibly can, but in a safe way,” ​Mr. Hogan said.As a stimulus bill omitting local aid advances, ‘are you telling New York City to drop dead?’ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Sunday they were nearing agreement with the White House to break a political logjam and provide more emergency aid for small businesses and hospitals, as well as to expand testing. Omitted from the bill is any direct aid for states or cities that are struggling to cope with the pandemic, an issue that drew pointed remarks from Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York.The $349 billion small-business emergency fund ran out of money last week, and Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating over the weekend about the terms for replenishing it. On the ABC program “This Week,” Ms. Pelosi said the two sides were “very close to agreement.”\n",
      "Mr. Schumer said a deal could come as soon as Sunday night. “We’ve made very good progress, and I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or early tomorrow morning,” Mr. Schumer said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” He added that many of the Democrats’ requests, including money for testing and hospitals, “they’re going along with, so we feel pretty good.”Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNN Sunday that he was hopeful that the Senate could pass legislation as soon as Monday and that the House would take it up for a vote on Tuesday. The bill would include $300 billion to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program, $50 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief fund, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. Democrats wanted the plan to also include money for states and municipalities, but Mr. Mnuchin said that would be included in a future relief package. Mr. de Blasio derided President Trump on Sunday for failing to speak out about federal aid to municipalities. “What’s going on? Cat got your tongue?” Mr. de Blasio said during his daily briefing. “You’re usually really talkative. You usually have an opinion on everything. How on earth do you not have an opinion on aid to American cities and states?”The mayor, who said earlier in the week that New York City would have to slash more than $2 billion in municipal services over the next year, compared President Trump’s silence with President Gerald Ford’s dismissal of New York City’s plight during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.“There was that famous Daily News cover that said ‘Ford to City: Drop Dread,’” Mr. de Blasio said. “So my question is, Mr. Trump, Mr. President, are you going to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead? Which one is it?”“You are failing to protect the very people you grew up around,” Mr. de Blasio added.The pandemic may profoundly alter U.S. cities.The pandemic has hit America’s biggest cities hard, with the coronavirus finding found fertile ground in their density, just as major urban centers were already losing their appeal for many Americans. Skyrocketing rents and changes in the labor market have been pushing the country’s youngest adults toward suburbs and smaller cities. Will that current turn into a flood?The country’s three largest metropolitan areas — New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — have all lost population in the past few years, according to an analysis by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. And over all, growth in the country’s major metropolitan areas fell by nearly half over the past decade, Mr. Frey found.Now, as local leaders contemplate how to reopen, the future of life in America’s biggest, most dense cities is unclear. Mayors warn of precipitous drops in tax revenue because so many people are now unemployed and so many businesses are closed. Public spaces like parks and mass transit systems, the central arteries of urban life, have become danger zones. And with vast numbers of professionals working remotely, some may reconsider whether they need to live and work in the middle of a big city.“This pandemic has stretched the fabric that was already tearing,” said Aaron Bolzle, the executive director of Tulsa Remote, a program that offers $10,000 to remote workers who relocate to Tulsa, Okla.Of course, the same financial uncertainty that would encourage a move may also make it more difficult. And in general, recessions — recent ones, at least — have tended to be good for cities. But a pandemic makes the equation different, and hard to predict.Labs warn of quality problems with new antibody tests.The United States has seen a rollout of blood tests for coronavirus antibodies in recent weeks. The tests, which are meant to detect past exposure and possible immunity, not current cases of Covid-19, have been widely heralded as crucial tools in assessing the reach of the pandemic in the United States.But for all their promise, the tests are already raising alarms. Officials fear the effort may prove as problematic as the deployment of earlier diagnostic tests. Criticized for a tragically slow and rigid oversight of those tests months ago, the federal government is now faulted by public health officials and scientists for greenlighting the antibody tests too quickly and without adequate scrutiny.Tests of “frankly dubious quality” have flooded the American market, said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.A judge in Kansas lifts restrictions on church gatherings.A federal judge in Kansas has issued a temporary restraining order setting aside the governor’s explicit prohibition on church gatherings in the state. Congregations in Kansas may now meet for in-person services. The ruling, handed down on Saturday, is the latest chapter in the lengthy back-and-forth battle over the issue.In the days leading up to Easter Sunday, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, amended her earlier executive order to include churches in a prohibition on mass gatherings. Republican lawmakers responded by overriding that part of her executive order, but just hours before most Christian denominations were to celebrate Easter on April 12, the state Supreme Court upheld the governor’s order. (Most Orthodox denominations are marking the holiday today.)Two churches — First Baptist in Dodge City and Calvary Baptist in Junction City — sued the governor in federal court, arguing that her order infringed upon their First Amendment rights to exercise their religion. Governor Kelly’s lawyers have argued that the order did not target religious activity. But the federal judge, John W. Broomes of the United States District Court in Kansas, was skeptical of that explanation, noting that churches had initially been deemed an essential function, and thus exempt from the original executive order. The governor later withdrew that exemption, while continuing to allow gatherings at airports, production facilities and offices, among other locations.Judge Broomes wrote in his ruling that because the governor’s stay-at-home order exempts many secular activities from its ban on large gatherings, “churches and religious activities appear to have been singled out among essential functions for stricter treatment.”“The exemption for religious activities has been eliminated while it remains for a multitude of activities that appear comparable in terms of health risks,” the judge wrote.The judge’s order requires churches to practice social distancing in other respects. A hearing on whether to make the restraining order permanent has been scheduled for Thursday.Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case CountA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.How the coronavirus became a new frontier in the fight for civil rights.The coronavirus pandemic has hit African-Americans and Hispanics especially hard, including in New York, where the virus is twice as deadly for those populations. So in the midst of a national quarantine, civil rights activists are organizing campaigns at home from their laptops and cellphones. Collectively, the goals are targeted legislation, financial investments, and government and corporate accountability. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the longtime civil rights leader, is calling for the creation of a new Kerner Commission to document the “racism and discrimination built into public policies” that make the pandemic measurably worse for some African-Americans.“It’s really hard to overstate the critical moment we are in as a people, given how this virus has ripped through our community,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization with 1.7 million members. “We know the pain will not be shared equally.”Mr. Robinson’s organization and others, such as the National Urban League and the N.A.A.C.P., have hosted telephone and virtual town halls, drafted state and federal policy recommendations and sent letters to legislators.Smaller local groups are working around social distancing restrictions to rally support. And across the country, individuals are making direct pleas for all to help slow the outbreak’s spread.“I am trying to sound the alarm because I see the devastation in the black community,” Michael Fowler, the coroner of Dougherty County, said hours after the Georgia county’s 91st Covid-19 death. “Preachers, a judge, a church choir member, all walks of life are dying. My job is to pronounce death, but I believe in trying to save lives.”Scrambling behind the scenes as Hollywood comes to a halt.As with much of life around the world, film and television production has ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving actors, stylists, directors, studio chiefs, grips, writers, set builders, trailer cutters, agents and scores of other specialized Hollywood workers at home and confronting the same question: Now what?Across the industry, shooting is not expected to resume until August a the soonest, in part because of the time it will take to reassemble casts and crews once the coronavirus threat subsides. That leaves a vast number of people without work. Hollywood supports 2.5 million jobs, according to the Motion Picture Association of America, and many of the workers are freelancers, getting paid project to project.“I keep telling myself, ‘Panicking is not going to help,’” said Muffett Brinkman, an associate casting director who has been unemployed for more than a month. “Hopefully things restart before I’m completely financially ruined.”What could the year ahead look like for the U.S.?When can people safely emerge from their homes? How long, realistically, before there is a coronavirus treatment or vaccine? How can the virus be kept at bay?More than 20 experts in public health, medicine, epidemiology and history shared their thoughts on the future during in-depth interviews with The New York Times.Some said that American ingenuity, once fully engaged, might produce advances to ease the burdens. Several saw a path forward that depends on factors that are difficult but possible: a carefully staggered approach to reopening, widespread coronavirus testing and tracking, a treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers — and eventually an effective vaccine.“My optimistic side says the virus will ease off in the summer and a vaccine will arrive like the cavalry,” one said. “But I’m learning to guard against my essentially optimistic nature.”Most experts believed that once the crisis is over, the nation and its economy will revive quickly — but that there will be no escaping a period of intense pain.A somber broadcast remembers the Oklahoma City bombing.The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed 25 years ago today, in what remains\n",
      "America’s deadliest single homegrown act of terrorism. The bombing killed 168 people, including 19 children.The coronavirus outbreak has forced the National Memorial Museum to cancel the weeklong series of events meant to mark the occasion. Instead, the museum recorded an hourlong memorial program that was broadcast on local television stations Sunday morning and is available online.The virtual ceremony started with 168 seconds of silence, while the video showed the main, poignant memorial to the dead. Rows of bronze, stone and glass chairs, 168 in all, overlook the reflecting pool built where the building once stood.Then a series of prominent politicians made brief remarks, before survivors read the names of those who perished.A white supremacist, Timothy McVeigh, built a 7,000-pound truck bomb that he blew up at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, shearing off the building’s glass face and pancaking its nine floors.Before he was executed in June 2001, Mr. McVeigh expressed disappointment that his attack did not ignite a widespread uprising against the U.S. government.The bombing remains something of an anomaly.Between Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, it was the deadliest deliberate attack on the United States, yet it has not been similarly woven into the tapestry of American history. Many historians, along with those who were attacked, worry that the memory is fading even as the violent ideology that inspired Mr. McVeigh spreads.“In today’s political environment, I hear echoes of the kind of rhetoric that I think inspired the perpetrators of the bombing,” said David F. Holt, the mayor of Oklahoma City.School cafeterias are now feeding whole families.After the coronavirus shut down America’s education system, districts fortified their school meals programs to ensure that their most needy students would stay fed. One month in, school leaders realize that the federal programs set up to subsidize meals for tens of millions of students cannot meet the demands of an emergency that has turned their cafeterias into food banks and community kitchens.Several districts are now feeding adults and sending days’ worth of food home for entire families. And they are doing so at a cost that under federal rules they will not recoup.The nation’s 12 largest school districts will spend $12 million to $19 million through the end of June to meet the demands of their pandemic meals operations, estimated Katie Wilson, the executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance, whose members include large urban districts in Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York and Chicago.The organization, which is pleading for relief from Congress, the Agriculture Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has also set up a donation page to help districts cover costs.“Every one of these schools that has their doors open are literally heroes on the front line,” Ms. Wilson said. “Food workers are now first responders.”Around the globe: Volunteers are enforcing India’s lockdown and stoking divisions. India has pursued its lockdown — the world’s largest — with remarkable zeal.People aren’t just dutifully following the law. Many are going above and beyond it. Volunteer virus patrol squads are popping up everywhere, casting an extra net of vigilance over the entire country. Neighborhoods are imposing extra rules and sealing themselves off.The volunteer efforts could help India protect its people from the pandemic. But there’s a downside: concerns about overzealous enforcement targeting the poor and minorities.Lower castes are being shunned more than usual. The term “social distancing” plays straight into centuries of ostracism of certain groups who until recently were called “untouchable.” Muslims, a large minority in a Hindu-dominated land, are facing a burst of bigotry and attacks. “This is one of the problems of overzealousness,’’ said Adarsh Shastri, a politician in the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party. “People get a chance to enforce the laws per their own personal prejudice.”Elsewhere:\n",
      "At least 40 staff members in Afghanistan’s presidential palace have tested positive for Covid-19, forcing President Ashraf Ghani to isolate himself and attend events via video conference amid a raging war with the Taliban.About 100,000 people in Bangladesh ignored a nationwide lockdown to attend the funeral of Maulana Jubayer Ahmed Ansari, a senior member of an Islamist party, amid fears that the virus could spread quickly through the densely populated country.In France, pride in the country’s aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, has given way to finger-pointing and investigations over an outbreak that tore through the vessel’s cramped quarters, infecting more than 1,000 sailors.Our Tokyo bureau chief writes that the city may have been lulled into complacency during the weeks when Japan contained the coronavirus and has seemed “seduced by magical thinking, presuming we are immune when so many others around the world are not.”A return for baseball requires a new debate.If M.L.B. and the players’ union need to fight over the details about a return to play, it may mean that such a return is possible, our columnist Tyler Kepner writes.America wants a baseball season. Nobody knows quite how that will look amid the coronavirus pandemic. Those are the only certainties for a sport that has an unbroken chain of seasons with at least 100 games stretching back to the 19th century.Hopeful hints emerged last week from Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who both touted the feasibility of having teams plays in empty ballparks. But a quandary loomed: If teams cannot sell tickets, how much will the players be paid?“The issue over pay without fans is going to get ugly,” said a top official of one team who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about league matters. “Owners will claim they’d lose money by playing without fans if players get their full per-game salaries, and it may be true. They’re going to want a big reduction in pay from players.”When Major League Baseball and the players’ union agreed on new rules for the delayed season on March 26 — the original opening day — they vowed to discuss “the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate substitute neutral sites.”For the owners, that set up a negotiation on pay structure. But the players’ side has a different interpretation of “economic feasibility,” according to the agent Scott Boras.In a way, this would be a welcome fight, because it would force baseball to set out a clear path to returning. That does not yet exist, and it depends largely on the availability of coronavirus tests, the spread of the pandemic, and authorization from state and local governments.With lockdowns in place, Jehovah’s Witnesses are limited in spreading their message.Across America, most religious groups have stopped coming together in large numbers to pray and hold services, in keeping with stay-at-home orders. They have improvised with online preaching and even drive-in services. Mormons have stopped going door-to-door in the U.S. and called home many missionaries working abroad.Jehovah’s Witnesses — with 1.3 million members in the U.S. who hand out brochures on sidewalks and subway platforms and ring doorbells — are one of the most visible religious groups in the nation. Members are called on to share scriptures in person with nonmembers, warning of an imminent Armageddon and hoping to baptize them with the prospect of living forever.Yet the pandemic led the group’s leaders to decide that, in the interest of safety, Jehovah’s Witnesses should stop witnessing, its practice of in-person attempts at converting people to the group.The move was the first of its kind in the nearly 150 years that the group has existed. It followed anguished discussions at Watchtower headquarters, with leaders deciding on March 20 that knocking on doors would leave the impression that members were disregarding the safety of those they hoped to convert.“This was not an easy decision for anybody,” said Robert Hendriks, the group’s U.S. spokesman. “As you know, our ministry is our life.”Clearing up confusion about keeping safe distances.Six feet is the suggested space to keep between people in stores and on casual strolls, but when we walk briskly or run, air moves differently around us, increasing the space required to maintain a proper social distance.Vacation spots near New York fear that visitors will bring the virus with them.Visitors to the western end of Fire Island are greeted by a large sign telling them to “Stop, turn around, go back.”Visiting Fire Island is not banned — a resident put up the unofficial sign — but it is strongly discouraged by local officials who fear that outsiders might bring the coronavirus to this 32 mile-long barrier island east of New York City.Like many summer vacation areas, the region’s island communities have looked with trepidation at the encroaching virus and the visitors who might be carrying it with them. But the islands have been especially adamant about avoiding possible exposure from newcomers, in part because the isolation that makes them charming also makes them terrible places to fall ill.Although their county, Suffolk, has become a virus hot spot, Fire Island, Shelter Island, Fishers Island each have had few or no documented cases. The same goes for Block Island, just beyond New York waters in Rhode Island.And — fearful that an outbreak that would overwhelm their bare-bones, off-season medical and emergency rescue services — the islands want to keep it that way.Those we’ve lost: Tarlach MacNiallais, who fought for gay and disability rights, dies at 57.Tarlach MacNiallais was known for his decades of advocacy for L.G.B.T.Q. and disability rights.“A battering ram on issues of importance,” according to Harriet Golden, a vice president at A.H.R.C. New York City, an organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, where Mr. MacNiallais worked for nearly 35 years.Moving from Northern Ireland to New York in the mid-1980s, Mr. MacNiallais became involved in the protracted struggle by L.G.B.T.Q. groups to be fully included in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. Many years later, he became a member of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade formation committee, and marched in the parade with the Lavender and Green Alliance in 2016.Mr. MacNiallais died on April 1. He was 57. The cause was complications of the coronavirus, according to friends and family.Those We’ve LostThe coronavirus pandemic has taken an incalculable death toll.

      "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n",
      "Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n",
      "Updated April 11, 2020\n",
      "When will this end?\n",
      "This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)\n",
      "What should I do if I feel sick?\n",
      "If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n",
      "Should I wear a mask?\n",
      "The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n",
      "How do I get tested?\n",
      "If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n",
      "How does coronavirus spread?\n",
      "It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n",
      "Is there a vaccine yet?\n",
      "No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n",
      "What makes this outbreak so different?\n",
      "Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.\n",
      "What if somebody in my family gets sick?\n",
      "If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.\n",
      "Should I stock up on groceries?\n",
      "Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n",
      "Can I go to the park?\n",
      "Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n",
      "Should I pull my money from the markets?\n",
      "That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n",
      "What should I do with my 401(k)?\n",
      "Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”\n",

      "Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[14] Sanger coined its name,[15][16] as a portmanteau of \"wiki\" (the Hawaiian word for \"quick\")[17] and \"encyclopedia\". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.1 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 52 million articles[18] attracting 1.5 billion unique visitors per month.[19][20]\n",
      "In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,[21] although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.[22][23] The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[24]\n",
      "Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of \"truth, half truth, and some falsehoods\",[25] and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.[26] Wikipedia has also been criticized for gender bias, particularly on its English-language site, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[27][28] Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.[29]\n",

      "Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called Nupedia\n",
      "Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.[30] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[31] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[32][33] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[34] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[35][36] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[37] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[38]\n",
      "Launch and early growth\n",
      "The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001[39] and January 13, 2001[40] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[31] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[41] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[35] Wikipedia's policy of \"neutral point-of-view\"[42] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[35] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[43]\n",
      "The Wikipedia Page on December 17, 2001\n",
      "Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.[44] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[45]\n",
      "Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[46] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[47] Brion Vibber applied the change on August 15, 2002.[48]\n",
      "Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[49] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[50] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.[51] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \"low-hanging fruit\"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[52][53][54]\n",
      "Play media\n",
      "A promotional video of the Wikimedia Foundation that encourages viewers to edit Wikipedia, mostly reviewing 2014 via Wikipedia content\n",
      "In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[55][56] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[57] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.[58] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\".[59] A 2013 article titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" in MIT's Technology Review questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae.[60] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.[61] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis\".[62]\n",

Languages with less than 1000 articles are represented with one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate colour.\n",
      "In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the US, according to comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors.[63] As of September 2019[update], Wikipedia has rank 9[9] among websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet. In 2014, it received eight billion pageviews every month.[64] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\".[19]\n",
      "Wikipedia blackout protest against SOPA on January 18, 2012\n",
      "On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.[65] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.[66][67]\n",
      "Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through \"stigmergic accumulation\".[68][69]\n",
      "On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\"[70] Varma added that, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\"[70] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\"[70]\n",
      "By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally.[71]\n",
      "In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, Wikipedia became available as 7,473 books for $500,000. In 2019, a species of flowering plant was named Viola wikipedia.[72]\n",

      "Openness\n",
      "Number of English Wikipedia articles[76]\n",
      "English Wikipedia editors with >100 edits per month[77]\n",
      "Differences between versions of an article are highlighted\n",
      "Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[note 3][78] regarding the security of its content.[78] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.\n",
      "Restrictions\n",
      "Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[79] On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to some degree.[80][81] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.[82] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.[83]\n",
      "In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \"stable versions\" of articles,[84] which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012.[85] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[86]\n",
      "The editing interface of Wikipedia\n",
      "Review of changes\n",
      "Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The \"History\" page of each article links to each revision.[note 4][87] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a \"watchlist\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \"New pages patrol\" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[88]\n",
      "In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\".[89]\n",
      "Vandalism\n",
      "Main article: Vandalism on Wikipedia\n",
      "Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.[90] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.[91]\n",
      "American journalist John Seigenthaler (1927–2014), subject of the Seigenthaler incident.\n",
      "Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.[92][93] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.[94]\n",
      "In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[94] The article remained uncorrected for four months.[94] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[95][96] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\".[94] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[97]\n",
      "Edit warring\n",
      "Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\".[98][99] The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.[100] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[101] conflict based[102] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[103] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.\n",
      "Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests. Defending Israeli settlements in the West Bank, numerous pro-occupation groups have launched \"Zionist editing\" campaigns.[104] In 2010, the then-director general of the Yesha Council and former Israeli Cabinet Minister Naftali Bennett described their goal \"as not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view\".[105]\n",
      "Policies and laws\n",
      "External video Wikimania, 60 Minutes, CBS, 20 minutes, April 5, 2015, co-founder Jimmy Wales at Fosdem\n",
      "Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the \"five pillars\" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.[106] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[84]\n",
      "Content policies and guidelines\n",
      "According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[107] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\",[108] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[109] It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[110] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.[111] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[112] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Further information: Wikipedia:Administration\n",
      "Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[113][114] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[115]\n",
      "Administrators\n",
      "Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with \"administrator\",[116][117] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).[118][119]\n",
      "Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.[120]\n",
      "Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n",
      "Dispute resolution\n",
      "Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,[note 5] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".\n",
      "Arbitration Committee\n",
      "Main article: Arbitration Committee\n",
      "The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[121] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.[122]\n",

      "Wikipedians and British Museum curators collaborate on the article Hoxne Hoard in June 2010\n",
      "Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[124] although not always with entirely negative connotations.[125] The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as \"anti-elitism\".[126]\n",
      "Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.[127]\n",
      "Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[128] As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.[129] Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\".[130] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\"[131] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[132]\n",
      "The English Wikipedia has 6,061,040 articles, 38,815,719 registered editors, and 135,447 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.\n",
      "Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".[133] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[133] as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\",[134] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.\n",
      "Studies\n",
      "A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\".[135] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\"[130] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\".[130]\n",
      "A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[136][137] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[138] According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\".[139]\n",
      "Diversity\n",
      "Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[140] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[141] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\".[142] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[143]\n",

      "Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[149] or points of view.[150]\n",

They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[155] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[156] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[157] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n",

      "Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles.[158] Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.\n",
      "A study published by PLoS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.[159] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015.[160]\n",

The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\n",
      "Should attrition continue unabated at the quoted trend rate of approximately 20,000 editors lost within a seven-year stretch, by 2021 there will be only 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia.[161] In contrast, the trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.[161] No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[162]\n",

      "Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black criticized Wikipedia for being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\".[25] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[165][166][167]\n",
      "Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black noted (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) how articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic.[25][168] A 2008 article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.[26]\n",

      "Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[170] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.\"[21] Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\"[22] Others raised similar critiques.[23] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,[171][172] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.[173] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).[174]\n",
      "As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[175] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity,[176] the insertion of false information,[177] vandalism, and similar problems.\n",
      "Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[178]\n",
      "Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[179] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[180] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[181] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[182]\n",

      "In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal, to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[185] The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'\"[185][186][187][188][189] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[190]\n",
      "A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\".[191]\n",
      "Discouragement in education\n",
      "Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[192] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[193][194] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[195] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,\" he said.[196]\n",
      "In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[197] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,[198] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\".\n",

Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\"[202]\n",
      "Quality of writing\n",
      "Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia[203]\n",
      "In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination.[204] For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its \"clear and engaging prose\", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.[205] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised \"McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\" By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds \"both verbose and dull\". Rosenzweig also criticized the \"waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\". While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of such \"waffling\", which then stated: \"Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.\"[205]\n",
      "Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, \"Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 percent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage.\"[206] A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University. The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the \"start\" class or \"stub\" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that \"Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing\".[207] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: \"inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information\".[208]\n",

Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[210] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[211][212] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[213] and Pakistan,[214] amongst other countries.\n",

      "Systemic bias\n",

In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\".[59] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[60]\n",
      "Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally,[vague] for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions.[221] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events.[221]\n",
      "Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.[222][223] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism, and Muhammad.[223] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[223]\n",

If we did, we would remove it.\"[231] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\".[232] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[233]\n",

The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[240] The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million.[241]\n",
      "In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[242] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\"[243][244] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,\" Walsh said.[243]\n",
      "Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[245] Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.\"[246]\n",
      "Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.\n",
      "Software operations and support\n",
      "See also: MediaWiki\n",
      "The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.[247] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.\n",
      "Several MediaWiki extensions are installed[248] to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.\n",
      "In April 2005, a Lucene extension[249][250] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1,[251][needs update] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3.[252]\n",
      "In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[253][254][255][256] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\".[257] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.\n",
      "Automated editing\n",
      "Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[258][259][260] One controversial contributor creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[261] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[262] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[259] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[263] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[264]\n",
      "According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[265]\n",

      "See also: Wikimedia Foundation § Hardware\n",
      "Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.[266][needs update] As of 2019[update], page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers.[267] Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available.[268] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.\n",
      "Overview of system architecture as of October 2015[update]\n",
      "Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu).[269][270] As of December 2009[update], there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.[271] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.[272][273] in 2017, Wikipedia had installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[274]\n",
      "Internal research and operational development\n",
      "In accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported,[60] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[275] Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized \"Thank\" tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success.[60][257] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[276] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[276] In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by Bloomberg News as being at $77 million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[276]\n",
      "Internal news publications\n",
      "Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost, founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.[277] It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikimedia Commons. Similar publications are the German-language Kurier, and the Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia. Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the Wikiworld webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education.\n",
      "Access to content\n",
      "Content licensing\n",
      "When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[278] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[279] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[280][281][282][283]\n",
      "The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[284]\n",
      "The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court.[285][286]\n",
      "Methods of access\n",
      "Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\n",
      "Websites: Thousands of \"mirror sites\" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are Reference.com and Answers.com. Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.\n",
      "Mobile apps: A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on hand-held devices, including both Android and iOS devices (see Wikipedia apps). (See also Mobile access.)\n",
      "Search engines: Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Bing (via technology gained from Powerset)[287] and DuckDuckGo.\n",
      "Compact discs, DVDs: Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles.[288][289] The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles.[290] There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well.[291][292] Also, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and SOS Children, is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the UK National Curriculum and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world.[293] The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes.\n",
      "Printed books: There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[294][295] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.[296]\n",
      "Semantic Web: The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable semantic format, RDF. This is still under development. As of February 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and 1,000 properties for describing them.\n",
      "Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[297] Wikipedia publishes \"dumps\" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007[update] there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[298]\n",
      "Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[299]\n",

      "The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page\n",
      "Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.[19] The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\"[19] The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[19]\n",
      "Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.[300] At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.[244] The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[301] The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[302]\n",
      "Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,[303] located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS-based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation.[304][305]\n",

Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[60] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[308][309]\n",

Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.\"[29] In answer to the question of 'how engaged are visitors to the site?'

      "In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[310] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[311] About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,[312] a good portion of which is related to academic research.[313] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[314] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[315] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[316]\n",

For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment.\" Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit. ''dare to know''), social networks have led to a culture of \"[d]are not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"[338]\n",

      "There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\" said Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian.[366]\n",
      "Research use\n",
      "Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called \"wikification\",[367] and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation.[368] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia.[369]\n",
      "In 2015, French researchers Dr José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[370][371][372] They used PageRank \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order).\"[372]\n",
      "A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[373][374]\n",
      "A 2018 Charles University study concluded that Wikipedia is the most used OER for students of environmental studies (used by 95% of students) and argued that educational institutions should focus their attention on it (for example by supporting Wikipedians in residence).[375]\n",
      "Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations. One of the most important areas—automatic detection of vandalism[376][377] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia,[378] may include different measures for articles and infoboxes.[209]\n",
      "Related projects\n",
      "A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[379]\n",
      "Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[380] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[381] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n",
      "Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[382][383]\n",

There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

      "Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[14] Sanger coined its name,[15][16] as a portmanteau of \"wiki\" (the Hawaiian word for \"quick\")[17] and \"encyclopedia\". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.1 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 52 million articles[18] attracting 1.5 billion unique visitors per month.[19][20]\n",
      "In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,[21] although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.[22][23] The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[24]\n",
      "Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of \"truth, half truth, and some falsehoods\",[25] and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.[26] Wikipedia has also been criticized for gender bias, particularly on its English-language site, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[27][28] Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.[29]\n",

      "Main article: Nupedia\n",
      "Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called Nupedia\n",
      "Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.[30] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[31] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[32][33] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[34] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[35][36] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[37] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[38]\n",
      "Launch and early growth\n",
      "The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001[39] and January 13, 2001[40] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[31] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[41] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[35] Wikipedia's policy of \"neutral point-of-view\"[42] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[35] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[43]\n",
      "The Wikipedia Page on December 17, 2001\n",
      "Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.[44] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[45]\n",
      "Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[46] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[47] Brion Vibber applied the change on August 15, 2002.[48]\n",
      "Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[49] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[50] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.[51] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \"low-hanging fruit\"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[52][53][54]\n",
      "Play media\n",
      "A promotional video of the Wikimedia Foundation that encourages viewers to edit Wikipedia, mostly reviewing 2014 via Wikipedia content\n",
      "In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[55][56] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[57] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.[58] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\".[59] A 2013 article titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" in MIT's Technology Review questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae.[60] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.[61] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis\".[62]\n",

With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors.[63] As of September 2019[update], Wikipedia has rank 9[9] among websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet. In 2014, it received eight billion pageviews every month.[64] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\".[19]\n",

Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\"[70] Varma added that, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\"[70] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\"[70]\n",

      "Differences between versions of an article are highlighted\n",
      "Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle[note 3][78] regarding the security of its content.[78] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.\n",
      "Restrictions\n",
      "Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[79] On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to some degree.[80][81] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.[82] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.[83]\n",
      "In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \"stable versions\" of articles,[84] which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012.[85] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[86]\n",
      "The editing interface of Wikipedia\n",
      "Review of changes\n",
      "Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The \"History\" page of each article links to each revision.[note 4][87] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a \"watchlist\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \"New pages patrol\" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[88]\n",
      "In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\".[89]\n",
      "Vandalism\n",
      "Main article: Vandalism on Wikipedia\n",
      "Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.[90] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.[91]\n",
      "American journalist John Seigenthaler (1927–2014), subject of the Seigenthaler incident.\n",
      "Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.[92][93] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.[94]\n",
      "In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[94] The article remained uncorrected for four months.[94] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[95][96] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\".[94] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[97]\n",
      "Edit warring\n",
      "Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\".[98][99] The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.[100] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[101] conflict based[102] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[103] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.\n",
      "Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests. Defending Israeli settlements in the West Bank, numerous pro-occupation groups have launched \"Zionist editing\" campaigns.[104] In 2010, the then-director general of the Yesha Council and former Israeli Cabinet Minister Naftali Bennett described their goal \"as not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view\".[105]\n",
      "Policies and laws\n",
      "External video Wikimania, 60 Minutes, CBS, 20 minutes, April 5, 2015, co-founder Jimmy Wales at Fosdem\n",
      "Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the \"five pillars\" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.[106] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[84]\n",
      "Content policies and guidelines\n",
      "According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[107] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\",[108] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[109] It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[110] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.[111] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[112] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Further information: Wikipedia:Administration\n",
      "Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[113][114] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[115]\n",
      "Administrators\n",
      "Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with \"administrator\",[116][117] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).[118][119]\n",
      "Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.[120]\n",
      "Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n",
      "Dispute resolution\n",
      "Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,[note 5] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".\n",
      "Arbitration Committee\n",
      "Main article: Arbitration Committee\n",
      "The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[121] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.[122]\n",

      "Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.[127]\n",
      "Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[128] As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.[129] Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\".[130] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\"[131] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[132]\n",
      "The English Wikipedia has 6,061,040 articles, 38,815,719 registered editors, and 135,447 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.\n",
      "Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".[133] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[133] as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\",[134] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.\n",
      "Studies\n",
      "A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\".[135] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\"[130] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\".[130]\n",
      "A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[136][137] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[138] According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\".[139]\n",
      "Diversity\n",
      "Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[140] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[141] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\".[142] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[143]\n",

They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[155] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[156] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[157] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n",

The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\n",

In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black criticized Wikipedia for being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\".[25] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[165][166][167]\n",

      "Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[179] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[180] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[181] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[182]\n",

      "In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal, to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[185] The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'\"[185][186][187][188][189] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[190]\n",
      "A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\".[191]\n",
      "Discouragement in education\n",
      "Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[192] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[193][194] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[195] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,\" he said.[196]\n",
      "In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[197] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,[198] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\".\n",
      "In contrast, academic writing in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process.[199] Some academics suggest ‘Verifiability by respected sources’ as an indicator for assessing the quality of Wikipedia articles at the higher education level.[200]\n",

Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\"[202]\n",
      "Quality of writing\n",
      "Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia[203]\n",
      "In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination.[204] For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its \"clear and engaging prose\", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.[205] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised \"McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\" By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds \"both verbose and dull\". Rosenzweig also criticized the \"waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\". While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of such \"waffling\", which then stated: \"Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.\"[205]\n",
      "Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, \"Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 percent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage.\"[206] A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University. The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the \"start\" class or \"stub\" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that \"Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing\".[207] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: \"inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information\".[208]\n",

      "Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[210] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[211][212] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[213] and Pakistan,[214] amongst other countries.\n",

      "Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven.

      "Systemic bias\n",
      "When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\".[59] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[60]\n",
      "Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally,[vague] for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions.[221] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events.[221]\n",
      "Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.[222][223] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \"reverting/reverted pairs\" or \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism, and Muhammad.[223] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[223]\n",

In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers.[226]\n",
      "In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[227][228] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[229] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[229] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[230] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[231] saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\"[231] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\".[232] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[233]\n",

A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.\n",

'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,\" Walsh said.[243]\n",
      "Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[245] Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December.

MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.\n",

An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[259] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[263] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[264]\n",

This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[279] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[280][281][282][283]\n",
      "The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[284]\n",

      "Semantic Web: The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable semantic format, RDF. This is still under development. As of February 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and 1,000 properties for describing them.\n",
      "Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[297] Wikipedia publishes \"dumps\" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007[update] there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[298]\n",
      "Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[299]\n",

      "The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page\n",
      "Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.[19] The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\"[19] The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[19]\n",
      "Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.[300] At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.[244] The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[301] The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[302]\n",
      "Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,[303] located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS-based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation.[304][305]\n",
      "Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries.[306] It was discontinued in February 2018.[307]\n",
      "Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[60] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[308][309]\n",
      "Cultural impact\n",
      "Trusted source to combat fake news\n",
      "In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.\"[29] In answer to the question of 'how engaged are visitors to the site?' Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.04 and the daily time on site as 4.01 minutes.[9]\n",
      "Readership\n",
      "In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\"[19]\n",
      "In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[310] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[311] About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,[312] a good portion of which is related to academic research.[313] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[314] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[315] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[316]\n",
      "According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[317]\n",

      "Wikipedia Monument in Słubice, Poland (2014, by Mihran Hakobyan)\n",
      "Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[318][319][320] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[321] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[322]—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[323] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[324] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[325]\n",
      "Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[326][327] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[328][329][330]\n",
      "In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook)[331] in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.\n",
      "In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4[332] which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google, Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation.\n",
      "On September 28, 2007, Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[333]\n",

      "Jimmy Wales accepts the 2008 Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award on behalf of Wikipedia\n",
      "On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\"[334] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[335]\n",

      "A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth.\"[337]\n",
      "In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment.\" Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit. ''dare to know''), social networks have led to a culture of \"[d]are not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"[338]\n",

Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\".[347]\n",
      "In an episode of the television comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[348] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[349]\n",
      "\"My Number One Doctor\", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.[350]\n",

      "On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\"[356] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier and a trans woman.\n",
      "In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place or thing that it has left uncovered, and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[357][358]\n",
      "Sister projects—Wikimedia\n",
      "Main article: Wikimedia project\n",
      "Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[359] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[360] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide, and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.\n",
      "Publishing\n",
      "A group of Wikimedians of the Wikimedia DC chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the Encyclopædia Britannica (back left) at the US National Archives\n",
      "The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[361][362][363] Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, \"The amorality of Web 2.0\", that criticized websites with user-generated content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote: \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\"[364] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the \"wisdom of crowds\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process.[365]\n",
      "There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\" said Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian.[366]\n",
      "Research use\n",
      "Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called \"wikification\",[367] and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation.[368] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia.[369]\n",
      "In 2015, French researchers Dr José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[370][371][372] They used PageRank \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order).\"[372]\n",
      "A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[373][374]\n",
      "A 2018 Charles University study concluded that Wikipedia is the most used OER for students of environmental studies (used by 95% of students) and argued that educational institutions should focus their attention on it (for example by supporting Wikipedians in residence).[375]\n",
      "Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations. One of the most important areas—automatic detection of vandalism[376][377] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia,[378] may include different measures for articles and infoboxes.[209]\n",
      "Related projects\n",
      "A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[379]\n",
      "Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[380] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[381] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n",
      "Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[382][383]\n",

If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

The herd immunity strategy, which would allow a majority of the population to gain resistance to the virus by becoming infected and then recovering, could result in less economic devastation and human suffering than restrictive lockdowns designed to stop the virus's spread, a number of experts have begun to argue in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Blog: Level the field - News producers can’t keep incurring the costs while digital platforms drain away profits \"No country can afford a prolonged period of lockdowns, and least of all a country like India,\" said Jayaprakash Muliyil, a prominent Indian epidemiologist. \"You may be able to reach a point of herd immunity without infection really catching up with the elderly. And when the herd immunity reaches a sufficient number the outbreak will stop, and the elderly are also safe.\" A team of researchers at Princeton University and the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, a public health advocacy group based in New Delhi and Washington, has identified India as a place where this strategy could be successful because its disproportionately young population would face less risk of hospitalization and death. They said allowing the virus to be unleashed in a controlled way for the next seven months would give 60% of the country's people immunity by November, and thus halt the disease. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesMortality could be limited as the virus spreads compared to European nations like Italy given that 93.5% of the Indian population is younger than 65, they said, though no death toll projections were released. The radical proposal underscores the challenges that poorer developing countries — including nations like Indonesia and some in sub-Saharan Africa — face in curbing the epidemic using the lockdown measures that have been adopted by advanced economies. The impossibility of social distancing in crowded living conditions like in many cities and villages in India, the lack of testing kits to detect infections and the human suffering that occurs in lockdowns suggests a different path may be needed in these places.

      "Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news To do this, the Princeton and CDDEP team recommends lifting India's strict lockdown — which has been extended to May 3 — and letting most of the population younger than 60 return to normal life, though social distancing still would be encouraged, masks would be required and large gatherings would be banned. The reopening would be accompanied by an effort to test as many people as possible and isolate confirmed and suspected cases. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given no indication it plans to adopt such a strategy. Yet the government has laid out criteria that effectively rations coronavirus tests, limiting them to the very sick or most at risk. Critics who suspect the disease has spread much more widely than the official numbers suggest say the government's restrictive criteria amounts to allowing the disease to spread. \"In some sense, you are saying, we will let them get infected and recover, and take care only of those who are sick,\" said T Sundararaman, the New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People's Health Movement, a public health group. \"That's the policy, that's what it amounts to.\" The government has maintained its testing criteria gives an accurate tally of India's number of cases, and says the disease is not spreading untracked in the community. Nevertheless, as India has ramped up testing, it is finding more cases each day, bringing the nationwide tally to 19,984, with 640 deaths, as of April 22. But if questions remain as to the extent and severity of India's outbreak, the costs of the government's lockdown are clear. Local governments have had to set up camps to house 1.25 million migrants who left cities when they lost work, while food camps feed 7.5 million daily wage earners also rendered destitute by the lockdown. There are already signs these stopgap measures are starting to fray. \"We're dealing with a trade-off against starvation, hunger, all this other stuff,\" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the CDDEP and a Princeton researcher. By allowing the coronavirus to spread in a controlled way, \"undoubtedly there will be deaths, but it will be much smaller this way, and it opens us up for business by November,\" he said. But the strategy has already proved controversial internationally. The UK adopted and then abandoned it early in the pandemic after projections showed its health care system would be overwhelmed by the resulting hospitalizations. That brief dalliance is still being blamed for the British government's slow response in testing for the virus. Risky strategyEven in a country like India with a young population, the concept has inherent risks. Allowing people to become infected will inevitably bring many more patients to hospitals. The researchers say India will have to urgently expand critical care and isolation-bed capacity to ensure that multiple waves of patients don't become casualties before herd immunity is reached. Another risk is that India's worst-in the-world air pollution and high rates of hypertension and diabetes have compromised young people's health, meaning that mortality from the virus could be higher than expected. People may let their guards down and fail to follow social distancing guidelines. \"I would worry that it would relax concerns of younger individuals, who still remain at substantial risk themselves,\" Jason Andrews, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said in an email. \"The messaging in particular may lead younger people to perceive themselves as at lower risk than they are, and to fail to understand their potential role in transmission.\" And given the novel coronavirus only made its debut in humans some time late last year, there's still a lot that's unknown. Immunity from the virus may be a more complex process than expected. One group of researchers estimated as much as 82% of the population would have to be infected before herd immunity is reached. \"My view is there are a number of questions about whether it can work,\" said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health. \"The main questions being how much immunity do we need in the population, and how much immunity does each person get as a result of infection.\" Then there's also the question of whether it's possible to wall off the higher-risk portion of the population in densely packed India, where multiple generations commonly live under one roof. Ultimately, the researchers lobbying for the strategy argue that cultivating herd immunity may be the best of various bad options. \"I think eventually all countries will follow this Indian model,\" Laxminarayan said. \"Because otherwise we are going to be in lockdown on and off all the way through until June of next year.\" DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

Trump’s order imposes a 60-day halt in issuing green cards. The Senate approved a $484 billion relief plan.Right NowPresident Trump said on Twitter he would sign an executive order on Wednesday to limit immigration because of the coronavirus.Here’s what you need to know:Clues emerge on the origin of the nationwide spread, and the C.D.C. head warns of a “second wave” this winter.Trump backs away from a broad ban on immigration, but many will still feel effect of the restrictions.Disease detectives learn more about the virus’s spread — and why it will be so hard to contain.Stocks and oil prices rebound from waves of selling.California expands testing to include people who are asymptomatic, prioritizing those in communal facilities.The government assures small businesses that aid is on the way. But will it arrive this time?As the costs of the pandemic close in, many are rethinking even the smallest of expenditures.ImageAlong the East River in Brooklyn on Tuesday.Credit...Dave Sanders for The New York TimesClues emerge on the origin of the nationwide spread, and the C.D.C. head warns of a “second wave” this winter.Public health detectives trying to retrace the path of the coronavirus across America were offered another clue late Tuesday night when the medical examiner of Santa Clara California revealed that two people who died in their homes in early February were infected with the coronavirus — weeks before the first officially recorded death in Seattle.Neither of the victims had a travel history, meaning that in all probability they were infected in the community, indicating that the virus was already spreading at that time — a reminder of how swiftly the epidemic has transformed life in the country and around the world.The first death in California, on Feb. 6, was only 73 days ago.In a little over two months, the economy would grind to a halt, nearly the entire country and much of the world would be ordered to shelter at home and life would be transformed for nearly the entire planet.In that time, more than 40,000 Americans have died, part of a global toll of 172,000 — a number that most likely vastly underestimates the true count.Just as swiftly as the virus swept around the world, there was more evidence that the path out of the crisis would be a long, hard slog.The list of events being canceled is stretching into the summer and fall, and public health officials are warning that in the absence of a vaccine or reliable therapy, the risk of a “second wave” of infections later in the year remains a grave threat.“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post.The country, Dr. Redfield predicted, could “have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.”The stunning collapse of the world oil market, which saw the price of crude briefly fall into negative territory this week, was a reflection of the depth of the economic crisis and an indication of the lasting damage already inflicted.While the response to the virus across the United States has at times been marked by partisan division — with some Republican governors charging ahead with plans to ease restrictions despite the warnings of mayors of large cities and public health officials — Congress has moved to inject trillions to help businesses and workers survive.The Senate on Tuesday passed a bipartisan $484 billion coronavirus relief package that would replenish a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and provide funds for hospitals, states and coronavirus testing.But that may not be enough. The initial $349 billion was drained in just days, with much of the money going to bigger businesses and little or none to smaller establishments. In weeks to come, Congress is considering legislation that could result in an additional $1 trillion or more in relief.As that went ahead, President Trump announced Wednesday morning on Twitter that he would sign an executive order limiting immigration. The order imposes a 60-day halt in issuing green cards to prevent people from immigrating to the United States.Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case CountA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.Trump backs away from a broad ban on immigration, but many will still feel effect of the restrictions.Families that have waited years to be reunited, businesses that rely on foreign workers, universities that recruit international students with the promise of high-paying American jobs — all of their plans faced uncertainty on Tuesday as the Trump administration announced new restrictions on permanent residency in the United States.Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he would order a temporary halt in issuing green cards to prevent people from immigrating to the United States, but he backed away from plans to suspend guest worker programs after business groups exploded in anger at the threat of losing access to foreign labor.The president signaled that a 60-day ban on most green cards was intended to protect work opportunities for the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic. But if it is extended, its impact on businesses and families could be much broader. Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he would sign the executive order on Wednesday.The new policy would close the doors to thousands of people hoping to enter the United States or to lay down permanent roots in the country through long-term work or family connections — at least temporarily.“It’s really worrying news,” said Elsa Ramos, whose 22-year-old son, Eder, is in Honduras, waiting for a green card that would allow him to join his parents and sister in the United States.“Imagine the excitement that you have that your son is on his way into the country and then Trump destroys that,” Ms. Ramos said. “It’s really hard.”Mr. Trump, whose administration has faced intense criticism in recent months for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, abruptly sought to change the subject Tuesday night by resuming his assault on immigration, which animated his 2016 campaign and became one of the defining issues of his presidency.Lawyers at the Justice Department were still studying whether the president had the legal authority to unilaterally suspend the issuance of green cards, an order that caught officials at the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security off guard, according to people with knowledge of the announcement.The decision not to block guest worker programs — which provide specific visas for technology workers, farm laborers and others — is a concession to business groups, which assailed the White House on Tuesday.Rob Larew, the president of the National Farmers Union, said that even talk of restrictions on immigrant farm workers was disruptive. “It just adds to an already stressed food system,” he said.Disease detectives learn more about the virus’s spread — and why it will be so hard to contain.The announcement by officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., that two residents there died of the coronavirus in early and mid-February, making them the earliest known victims of the pandemic in the United States, may shift the timeline of the virus’s spread through the country weeks earlier than previously believed.The first report of a coronavirus-related death in the United States came on Feb. 29 in the Seattle area, although officials there later discovered that two people who had died on Feb. 26 also had the virus.But Santa Clara County officials said that autopsies of two people who died at their homes on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 showed that the individuals were infected with the virus. The presence of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was determined by tissue samples and was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, county health officials said in a statement.“Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown size,” Dr. Sara Cody, the county’s chief medical officer, said in an interview. “It feels quite significant.”Scientists around the world are also racing to use small genetic changes in the virus — biological markers that act as something like fingerprints for disease detectives — to map how the pathogen swept across the country and around the world.Mike Baker and Sheri Fink report on how the high-tech detective work of the researchers in Seattle and their partners elsewhere have opened the first clear window into how and where the virus was spreading — and how difficult it will be to contain.And Gina Kolata writes about how two new studies using antibody tests to assess how many people have been infected with the coronavirus have turned up numbers higher than some experts had expected.Both studies were performed in California: one among residents of Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, and the other among residents of Los Angeles County. In both cases, the estimates of the number of people infected in those counties were far higher than the number of confirmed cases.But in a reflection of how much remains unknown and how hard it is to draw sweeping conclusions, the studies, conducted by public health officials and scientists at Stanford University and the University of Southern California, have earned the ire of critics who questioned both the recruitment methods and the analyses.Stocks and oil prices rebound from waves of selling.Stocks on Wall Street and in major European markets rallied on Wednesday, and oil prices climbed more than 10 percent, reversing some of the tremendous losses that had unnerved investors for several days.The S&P 500 rose about 2 percent in early trading, after a nearly 5 percent drop on Monday and Tuesday.The selling earlier in the week had been triggered by a collapse in oil prices, as the price of one oil benchmark dipped below zero for the first time, meaning some holders were ready to pay people to take a barrel off their hands.But on Wednesday, some stability returned to the energy market.Futures contracts for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark, were up more than 11 percent at $12.92 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell nearly 18 percent earlier in the day but then recovered to gain 5 percent, at $20.30 a barrel — still a remarkably low price.Bond prices on Wednesday also signaled some returning investor optimism. U.S. Treasury bond prices fell, a signal that the markets were favoring putting money in places considered less conservative.Delta Air Lines, though, reported a loss of $607 million between January and March, its first quarterly loss in five years.The airline said it ended March with about $6 billion in cash on hand, but added that it was also burning through $100 million in cash per day by the end of that month. After cutting costs and expenses, Delta expects to slow that rate to $50 million per day by the end of June.Under the stimulus passed last month, Delta received $5.4 billion in grants and loans to pay its employees. It said it is also eligible for a $4.6 billion loan under the law, should it decide to take it. The airline also said it plans to cut schedules by 85 percent in the second quarter, in line with competitors like United Airlines, which reported a $2.1 billion quarterly loss on Monday.California expands testing to include people who are asymptomatic, prioritizing those in communal facilities.Public health officials in California are expanding coronavirus testing to include some people who are asymptomatic, going beyond federal guidelines that have so far focused on testing people who were most at risk and showing symptoms.The new guidelines in California prioritize screening and testing people who are living in communal living facilities, such as prisons and homeless shelters, as well as asymptomatic health care employees working in hospitals or nursing homes. The expanded testing\n",
      "— which has already begun at a homeless shelter in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Skid Row —\n",
      "could offer an early glimpse of how widely the virus has infiltrated society, even among people who otherwise appear healthy. As many as 25 percent of people infected with the coronavirus may not show symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 200 people have been tested so far at the homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission, and at least 43 people had tested positive as of Tuesday afternoon, said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the public health director in Los Angeles County. Of the 43 who tested positive, she said more than half had not been showing symptoms. The results mirror findings of asymptomatic cases that have begun to emerge at other facilities in the United States, as officials ramp up aggressive testing. In Ohio, where an outbreak at a prison has become the country’s largest-known source of coronavirus infections, officials said that many of the people who tested positive did not appear sick. In Boston, where universal testing was conducted at a homeless shelter earlier this month, officials found that nearly everyone who tested positive had not been showing symptoms.Dr. Jim O’Connell, president of the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, said he was “baffled” by how many people without symptoms had tested positive at the shelter. “The lesson for this is there is so much we don’t know, and in this particular very poor and vulnerable population,” Mr. O’Connell said. “We suspect all around the country, this is probably going to be duplicated.”The government assures small businesses that aid is on the way. But will it arrive this time?Struggling to keep their businesses alive in the second month of compulsory closings, many owners of independent restaurants and bars across the country are starting to despair of getting the help they need to return.The relief bills that have passed Congress don’t seem to be working for them, they say. Emergency loans made available in the first injection of funds into the Paycheck Protection Program, said one New York baker, went to “people who knew people, and things got pushed around.”“It just seemed — corrupt is the word to use,” he said.Many are doubtful that a fresh injection of aid — including a $484 billion plan expected to win approval later this week — will solve their problems, and other measures they favor seem to be going nowhere.They are confused, they are angry and they all say they know a dozen other small-business owners just like them.“Independent restaurants have never had a great voice in Washington,” said Andy Ricker, the chef and founder of several Thai restaurants in Portland, Ore. “The people who have a voice in Washington have the money to pay for it. I don’t have a spare $1,000 a month to pay for this stuff.”As the costs of the pandemic close in, many are rethinking even the smallest of expenditures.As millions of Americans lose jobs, take pay cuts, close businesses and absorb family members into their homes, they are being forced to rethink where their money goes. Even before the scramble for new jobs can begin, people are cajoling creditors, looking for gig work or simply cutting back to get through the first few disorienting weeks.For some, the question is as simple as whether to spring for a jigsaw puzzle to keep from going corona crazy, and how much to tip the person who delivers it. But for many others, the stakes are far higher: a good credit score sacrificed to pay off certain bills before others, or ramen dinners rationed so that cash for groceries can be repurposed for an emergency fund.Lissa Gilliam and her husband are waiting for Washington State to make jobless benefits available to contractors through a federal assistance program, and hope to take advantage of a state program for maternity aid once their daughter is born in May. A $15,000 construction project planned for the rear of their house is on hold. They canceled their gym membership, their Hulu streaming service, multiple newspapers and even the Adobe Acrobat software that Ms. Gilliam uses for design work.“We’re trying not to spend money,” she said. “At a minimum, we need to hold on to our house.”Chinese agents spread messages that sowed virus panic in the U.S., according to American officials.The United States and China are engaged in a titanic information war over the pandemic, one that has added a new dimension to their global rivalry.The propaganda efforts go beyond text messages and social media posts directed at Americans. In China, top officials have issued directives to agencies to engage in a global disinformation campaign, according to American officials.The efforts were detailed in an investigative report by the New York Times reporters Edward Wong, Matthew Rosenberg and Julian E. Barnes:The alarming messages came fast and furious in mid-March, popping up on the cellphone screens and social media feeds of millions of Americans grappling with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.Spread the word, the messages said: The Trump administration was about to lock down the entire country.“They will announce this as soon as they have troops in place to help prevent looters and rioters,” warned one of the messages, which cited a source in the Department of Homeland Security. “He said he got the call last night and was told to pack and be prepared for the call today with his dispatch orders.”The messages became so widespread over 48 hours that the White House’s National Security Council issued an announcement via Twitter that they were “FAKE.”Since that wave of panic, United States intelligence agencies have assessed that Chinese operatives helped push the messages across platforms, according to six American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss intelligence matters. The amplification techniques are alarming to officials because the disinformation showed up as texts on many Americans’ cellphones, a tactic that several of the officials said they had not seen before.That has spurred agencies to look at new ways in which China, Russia and other nations are using a range of platforms to spread disinformation during the pandemic, they said.The origin of the messages remains murky. American officials declined to reveal details of the intelligence linking Chinese agents to the dissemination of the disinformation, citing the need to protect their sources and methods for monitoring Beijing’s activities.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/3:34-3:34transcriptHow China Is Reshaping the Coronavirus NarrativeWe looked at China’s expansive propaganda system aimed at foreigners and analyzed thousands of English-language tweets from state media and diplomats. Here are the coronavirus messages China is projecting to the world.The Chinese government has one of the most extensive propaganda networks in the world inside the country, but it also aggressively works to influence how it’s perceived outside its borders. “Good morning, President Xi!” China has invested billions into bolstering its image abroad. Its state-run news outlets push out messages in English around the clock — “You’re watching CGTN.” “Live in Beijing.” “From Nairobi.” “Washington, D.C.” — and its diplomats have flocked to Twitter in the last year. But what happens when this massive P.R. apparatus has to do major damage control? We analyzed thousands of tweets from Chinese state media and official accounts and found three dominant messages China wants to project to the world. Here’s what we learned. A novel coronavirus hit the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. Early whistleblowers were silenced. People were angry about a government cover-up. But in the majority of tweets we analyzed, state-owned publications pushed a much more optimistic view, promoting what they said was an effective response. They are sharing videos like this. The Chinese Communist Party refers to this as positive energy, only focusing on the bright side of an issue. China did take drastic measures to try and stem the outbreak, but that’s the only story China wants the world to see. And state media is eager to run praise from foreign experts to back up China’s successes. One tweet from state media that did reveal Chinese citizens’ discontent — — it was quickly deleted. Once the virus spread across the world, China started positioning itself as being at the forefront of fighting the pandemic. It presented itself as a partner, a grateful recipient, and more recently a selfless leader, highlighting large donations from Chinese companies and the government. China hasn’t typically disparaged other countries’ responses to the virus, with one exception — the United States. “President Donald Trump has been accused of denying, downplaying and outright rejecting the concerns over the Covid-19 outbreak.” Another thing we noticed are Chinese outlets disputing the origin of the virus. It all started in late February with a renowned Chinese epidemiologist. Around the same time, the C.D.C. reported the first case in the United States with an unknown origin. A screenshot of the announcement incorrectly translated in Chinese began to trend online and was untouched by Chinese government censors. And a high-ranking government spokesperson actively pushed disinformation about where the virus came from. A government giving an optimistic spin to bad news is not unique. “We want to go big, go solid. The country is very strong. We’ve never been so strong.” But the scale of the Chinese propaganda machine is, and it’s clear that it’s being deployed to try and tell the world a new story about the coronavirus pandemic.We looked at China’s expansive propaganda system aimed at foreigners and analyzed thousands of English-language tweets from state media and diplomats. Here are the coronavirus messages China is projecting to the world.CreditCredit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesThe fight over easing restrictions divides the right.An informal coalition of influential conservative leaders and groups, some with close connections to the White House, has been quietly working to nurture protests and apply political and legal pressure to overturn state and local orders intended to stop the spread of the coronavirus.The groups have tapped their networks to drive up turnout at recent rallies in state capitals, dispatched their lawyers to file lawsuits, and paid for polling and research to undercut the arguments behind restrictions that have closed businesses and limited the movement of most Americans.Among those fighting the orders are FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots, which played pivotal roles in the beginning of Tea Party protests starting more than a decade ago, and a law firm led partly by former Trump White House officials. The effort picked up some influential support on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr expressed concerns about state-level restrictions potentially infringing on constitutional rights.While polls show a majority of Americans are more concerned about reopening the country too quickly, those helping orchestrate the fight against restrictions predict the effort could energize the right and potentially help President Trump as he campaigns for re-election.Noah Wall, the advocacy director for FreedomWorks, described the current efforts as appealing to a “much broader” group. “This is about people who want to get back to work and leave their homes,” he said.Jay Timmons, the head of the National Association of Manufacturers, one of America’s largest business lobbying groups, had another word for the protesters: idiots.“These people are standing so close together without any protection — with children, for God’s sakes,” Mr. Timmons said in an interview. “And they have no concern, and it’s all about them, and it’s all about what they want.”Who Is Organizing the Lockdown Protests?An informal coalition of influential conservative leaders and groups have quietly been encouraging demonstrations against lockdown orders across the country.The mortuary science professor who “came out of nowhere” to help New York.New York State has registered more than 14,800 deaths because of the coronavirus since the outbreak began in earnest in March, about 70 percent of them in New York City. Sandwiched between overflowing hospitals and backed up cemeteries, the city’s funeral homes have been functioning at maximum capacity. And the cases keep pouring in.Of the 50 crematories across the state, only four are in the city, and they have struggled to keep up with demand. Slots are now booked weeks in advance.So when the death toll mounted in March — hundreds one day, then hundreds more the next — an associate professor of mortuary science began reaching out to trade organizations and funeral directors. He would transport the dead, he said, to crematories in upstate New York and in neighboring states that were not seeing the same deluge of cases.Joe Neufeld Sr., a New York funeral home owner, did not know the professor, David Penepent, when he received his call, but he had heard of SUNY’s mortuary science program. Still, Mr. Neufeld said, he was initially “leery and unsure how this was going to work.”Now, he says, he cannot imagine how he would have managed without him.On Easter weekend, Mr. Penepent, 57, and his students moved about 70 bodies. Last week, using two vans, Mr. Penepent transported 150. This week they expected to take 300.“It’s a godsend,” said Mr. Neufeld, the owner of the Gerard J. Neufeld Funeral Home in Queens, which is just blocks from Elmhurst Hospital Center in one of the hardest hit areas in the country. “He came out of nowhere to save us.”Eating in a pandemic: Here’s some advice.Whether you are cooking meals from scratch every single day, turning to your childhood comfort foods, or don’t have much of an appetite, the coronavirus lockdown has probably changed your eating habits. Maybe for the better, or possibly for the worse. Here are some tips to ensure your diet is healthy and help you remember that moderation is key.What else is happening in the world?

      "Updated April 11, 2020\n",
      "When will this end?\n",
      "This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)\n",
      "What should I do if I feel sick?\n",
      "If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n",
      "Should I wear a mask?\n",
      "The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.\n",
      "How do I get tested?\n",
      "If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.\n",
      "How does coronavirus spread?\n",
      "It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n",
      "Is there a vaccine yet?\n",
      "No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n",
      "What makes this outbreak so different?\n",
      "Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.\n",
      "What if somebody in my family gets sick?\n",
      "If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.\n",
      "Should I stock up on groceries?\n",
      "Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n",
      "Can I go to the park?\n",
      "Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n",
      "Should I pull my money from the markets?\n",
      "That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n",
      "What should I do with my 401(k)?\n",
      "Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”\n",
